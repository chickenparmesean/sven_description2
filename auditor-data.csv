AMMplify,**samuraii77**,"- **Placements:** 3× 1st • 7× 2nd • 4× 3rd
- **Earnings:** $118.19K • Lead Senior Watson at Sherlock (X77)
- **Notable Engagements:** Peapods, Yielddoor, Infinifi, Royco, Saffron Uniswap V3 Vaults, Superlend
**Great Fit:**
In **Peapods**, samurai77 surfaced high-impact issues including faulty LP accounting and vault inflation vulnerabilities, reward extraction via early withdrawal, flawed fee accrual logic, leverage adjustment errors, and asset-pair mismatches.
In **Yielddoor**, he uncovered a secondary position tick miscalculation that caused idle funds or missed fees, and a multi-hop swap loop bug causing OOG and broken functionality.
In the **Infrared** audit, he identified two severe issues, a scenario in wrappedVault where reward tokens matching the staking token would become permanently stuck due to missing rescue logic, a mapping-clearing flaw in MultiRewards::getRewardForUser() that could cause direct reward loss if a token transfer failed"
AMMplify,**Oot2k**,"- **Placements:** 5× 1st • 1× 2nd • 1× 3rd
- **Earnings:** $65.04K
- **Notable Engagements:** MetaLend Ronin (Ronin-based lending protocol), predict.fun lending market, DODO Aerodrome integration (liquidity AMM), 40acres Finance veLending, MagicSea
**Great Fit:**
He co-audited MetaLend Ronin (a Ronin-based lending protocol) and the *predict.fun* lending market, identifying key flaws such as unintended collateral seizure and repayment-blocking issues. He has also reviewed DODO’s Aerodrome integration and 40acres Finance’s veLending.
From **MagicSea**, he addressed issues such as incorrect reward distribution due to wrong call ordering and state-bypassing via unlocked positions.
In Acres 40, borrowers can exploit `pay()` by setting an `increasePercentage` to reinvest part of a repayment after the loan balance is zeroed, letting them withdraw more than actually repaid.
From **Perpetual**, he has uncovered risks such as instant LP arbitrage draining makers through price manipulation and missing slippage checks.."
AMMplify,**0xeix**,"**Achievements**
- **Placements:** 3× 2nd Places, 6× 3rd Places
- **Earnings:** $161.56K Total Earnings
- **Notable Engagements:** Babylon, Oku Trade, 1inch, Beraborrow, Secondswap, Mantrachain
**Why they are a great fit:**
In Teller Finance, he uncovered a serious accounting error in `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` where the function used the original principal amount instead of the remaining principal to be repaid. This miscalculation could result in asset loss, especially when loans were partially repaid before defaulting.
He also identified a key vulnerability in a protocol’s `collateralFactor()` function, where the removal of a collateral asset from the list was not properly handled. This caused the system to underestimate total collateral value, leading to inaccurate risk assessment and unsafe rebalancing decisions.
In Mantrachain’s fee market module, he discovered a bug in the `ConvertToDenom` resolver function where the multiplier was incorrectly fetched using the base denom instead of `coin.Denom`. This caused conversion calculations to break for multi-fee-coin markets, potentially leading to incorrect fee charging."
AMMplify,**0x3b**,"- **Placements:** Ethos Network Financial Contracts (1st) • NextGen (1st) • Ethos Market Fix (2nd) • Superlend (private)
- **Earnings:** $37.67K • Lead Senior Watson at Sherlock (X77)
- **Notable Engagements:** Ethos Network Financial Contracts, NextGen, Ethos Market Fix, Superlend
**Great Fit:**
0x3b has found H/M vulnerabilities in systems with vaults, lending/borrowing flows, and AMM-like reward models. In **Ethos Network Financial Contracts**, he addressed overflows in reward tracking, enabling reward over-issuance, as well as fee and buy price manipulations.
In **Teller Finance**, he identified a critical issue in burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings where shares were burned before principal-per-share calculations, artificially increasing share value and allowing users to withdraw more than their proportional entitlement, as well as he also found that the interest rate in LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart was derived directly from the current utilization ratio, allowing borrowers to temporarily deposit funds, lower utilization, take loans at artificially reduced rates, and withdraw their deposits.
In **NextGen**, he identified lending logic flaws allowing and under-collateralized borrowing."

![S2 (22).png](S2_(22).png)
Sherlock is the leading audit contest and coverage platform. In 2024 alone, we conducted 155 audit competitions, more than any other contest platform. Sherlock competitions consistently uncover bugs that other auditors miss, thanks to our unique model that combines the rigor of a traditional manual audit with the broad participation and incentivization of an audit contest.
The effectiveness of Sherlock’s model has been demonstrated even with the most battle-tested codebases in crypto, such as Aave V3. In January 2025, during the [Aave V3.3](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/747?filter=questions) competition, one of Sherlock’s Lead Auditors identified two previously undiscovered medium-severity bugs in the live codebase, despite multiple prior audits by other firms.
![image.png](image%201.png)
Blackthorn is an exclusive security firm incubated by Sherlock, dedicated to protecting the most critical codebases using the expertise of the most accomplished researchers in the field. The team works exclusively with top-tier organizations in Web3, including the Ethereum Foundation, Aave, MakerDAO, Optimism, Cosmos, and a select few others.
Blackthorn draws on the skills of a carefully curated group of researchers who have consistently demonstrated exceptional performance in private audits and competitions. These individuals have uncovered high-severity bug bounties in well-established DeFi and infrastructure protocols. Comprising just 15 elite researchers, this team represents the top-performing auditors from a global community of over 10,000."
Aave V4 Audit Proposal,Our Understanding of Your Needs,"Based on our past conversations, we understand that Aave V4 is an ambitious evolution of past Aave protocols created to enhance modularity, reduce governance overhead, optimize capital efficiency, and integrate innovations such as GHO more seamlessly.
Unlike the past 3 versions of Aave, Aave V4 has a completely new architecture with a scalable and modular design. Because of this, auditors with strong overall DeFi experience may be more effective than those who are deeply familiar with Aave V3.
Aave V4 also includes decoupling liquidity management (Liquidity Hub) from borrowing strategies (Spokes). This architecture requires security researchers with strong experience auditing modular protocols and integrations.
We also understand that Aave V4’s equations and algorithms related to fees are quite novel and more math-intensive than previous versions. Researchers with strong math backgrounds and expertise with math-heavy protocols are important here.
Based on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of the world’s best auditors with these skillsets."
Aave V4 Audit Proposal,Blackthorn’s Audit Methodology,"The centerpiece of Blackthorn’s methodology is an intense emphasis on manual review by the world’s best auditors, with a focus on finding Critical vulnerabilities that defy core protocol invariants. Our auditors augment this core foundation with proprietary, cutting-edge tooling, giving them the ability to find vulnerabilities that escape the human eye alone."
Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**1. Early Testing with Cutting-Edge Tooling**,"- Sherlock has built an industry-leading proprietary AI audit product (used in production with dozens of teams), which researchers use to find early vulnerabilities and insights.
- Researchers also use SAST & Symbolic Execution tools like Slither and Mithril to scan for common vulnerabilities and low/informational issues as a baseline."
Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**2. Manual Review: Deep Dive into Architecture and Logic**,"- **Architecture & Data Flow Mapping**:
- Researchers then analyze interactions between modules (e.g., Liquidity Hub ↔ Spokes) to identify invariant violations or unintended dependencies.
- Next, they map execution paths to ensure alignment with design goals (e.g., liquidity transfers, spoke-specific accounting).
- **Line-by-Line Code Review**:
- Researchers prioritize high-risk components (e.g., debt accounting, liquidation logic, fee algorithms) to design protocol-breaking attack paths
- They take an iterative approach to investigating complex logic:
- Cross-referencing developer intent (via comments/annotations) with actual implementation.
- Reproducing critical calculations in controlled environments to validate precision."
Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**3. Tactical Fuzzing & Validation**,"- Where appropriate, fuzz tests are created to stress-test critical functions and uncover edge cases in state transitions or mathematical operations.
- Test suites are often extended to cover edge cases and validate findings."
Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**4. Reporting & Mitigation**,"- Blackthorn crafts structured reports including exploit steps, impact quantification, and targeted mitigation recommendations.
- Lead auditors work with the team during and after the audit to test fixes and ensure secure mitigations.
- Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is well-suited for a very novel codebase like Aave V4, as many vulnerabilities are likely to be unique and require creativity.
- Blackthorn’s deep expertise in cross-protocol DeFi integrations makes our researchers a great fit for securing a more modular intra-protocol architecture, such as Aave V4’s hub-and-spoke model.
- Blackthorn researchers’ backgrounds in advanced math, Symbolic Execution, and targeted fuzzing make them well-suited to finding vulnerabilities in Aave V4’s custom fee equations.
- Blackthorn’s deep history securing many of the largest and most unique DeFi protocols in the crypto space, such as Sky (MakerDAO), Symbiotic, Lombard, Babylon, Velodrome, etc. makes Blackthorn a great fit for securing a novel DeFi codebase like Aave V4.
- Aave V4 is expected to be one of the largest and highest-stakes protocols in the world, and Blackthorn researchers are well-suited to this assignment as they specialize in conducting the final audit before mainnet and finding Critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities in the world’s largest protocols that other audit teams miss.
![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)
Based on our past conversations, we understand that Aave V4 is completely different than Aave V3. This means strong expertise in DeFi in general may be more relevant than direct Aave V3 experience. We’ve also heard that Aave V4’s approach to fees (specifically the equations/algorithms) is quite novel and more math-intensive.
With this context, we’ve selected some of the world’s best DeFi generalists for this audit, particularly those with advanced mathematical backgrounds. Additionally, we’ve focused on demonstrated lending protocol expertise and experience with modular architectures. To summarize, we’ve selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 4 areas:
- Broad DeFi experience to easily understand Aave V4’s new design structure.
- Experience with math-heavy algorithms and interest models.
- Modular architecture expertise with a focus on hub-and-spoke architectures.
- Experience finding Critical issues in lending protocols, especially after previous audits.

Aave V4 Proposal (Dan),Sherlock – the leader in the audit contest space.,"Sherlock is the leading audit contest and coverage platform. In 2024 alone, we conducted 155 audit competitions, more than any other contest platform. Sherlock competitions consistently uncover bugs that other auditors miss, thanks to our unique model that combines the rigor of a traditional manual audit with the broad participation and incentivization of an audit contest.
The effectiveness of Sherlock’s model has been demonstrated even with the most battle-tested codebases in crypto, such as Aave V3. In January 2025, during the [Aave V3.3](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/747?filter=questions) competition, one of Sherlock’s Lead Auditors identified two previously undiscovered medium-severity bugs in the live codebase, despite it having already been audited by multiple firms.
**Blackthorn – a team of the most accomplished and elite security researchers.**
Blackthorn is an exclusive security firm incubated by Sherlock and dedicated to protecting the most critical codebases using the expertise of the most accomplished researchers in the space. The team works exclusively with top-tier organizations in web3, including the Ethereum Foundation, Aave, MakerDAO, Optimism, GMX, and a select few others.
Blackthorn draws on the skills of a carefully curated group of researchers who have consistently demonstrated exceptional performance in private audits and competitions. These individuals have uncovered high-severity bug bounties in well-established DeFi and infrastructure protocols. Comprising just 15 elite researchers, this team represents the top-performing auditors from a global community of 10,000."

**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MorphoV2?**
From our talks, we know Morpho Markets V2 has a new architecture that's very different from past versions. This means experience with fixed-rate protocols and P2P systems is more important than knowing the old Morpho pools. We also understand the Request for Quote (RFQ) model is a key part of the new design.
So, we picked auditors who are experts in the specific areas Markets V2 needs. We focused on auditors who are top-tier in four key areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Protocols:** Experience auditing protocols like Notional Finance, so they know the details of loan terms and interest.
• **RFQ and P2P Systems:** A proven ability to find bugs in peer-to-peer and RFQ-style systems.
• **Morpho's Architecture:** Deep knowledge of Morpho's core code, proven by top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.
• **Economic Security:** A history of finding major economic bugs related to incentives and liquidations in other complex lending protocols.
****"
Axal,Our Understanding of Your Needs,"We see Morpho Markets V2 as a big step forward, creating a new kind of fixed-rate lending market. It's a completely new design meant to support new financial products.
• **New Fixed-Rate & RFQ Model:** Instead of variable-rate pools, Markets V2 uses a P2P model where users agree on fixed-rate loans through an RFQ system. This creates new security risks around order matching, quote validation, front-running, and making sure the loan math is solid.
• **A Platform for Builders:** The protocol is a foundation for others, like Tenor, to build new features on top, like auto-renewing loans. This means the audit needs to check the core protocol *and* how it connects with other projects, making sure those connections can't be attacked.
• **Solid Economics and Incentives:** An RFQ system only works if the incentives make sense for both borrowers and lenders. The audit needs to hunt for economic bugs, like issues with oracles, bad incentives, or loopholes in the interest rate model.
That's why we've put together a team of auditors who have proven experience in these exact areas.
****
**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**
• **Experience with New DeFi Concepts:** Our focus on deep manual review is perfect for a new codebase like Markets V2. The custom logic in an RFQ system has unique bugs that only a creative, hands-on audit will find.
• **Hands-On Fixed-Rate & RFQ Experience:** This isn't just theory; our team has practical experience with fixed-rate platforms like Notional, intent-based systems like Velodrome, and even Morpho itself.
• **Securing Protocols Built for Integration:** We're experts at securing modular protocols that are meant to be built on. We know how to look beyond the core code and think about how integrations like Tenor's could create new risks.
• **Track Record on High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is going to be a key piece of DeFi infrastructure. Our researchers specialize in that final pre-launch audit for major protocols, where they find the critical bugs that others have missed."

He also examined Superform’s own cross-chain mechanisms (its “Superform DAO” vault bridge) and experimental bridges like the **Maia DAO** integrator, ensuring that asset transfers across networks correctly enforce fees and gas limits.
- **ERC-4626 vaults:** Conducted audits of Arcadia, Teller, and MaxAPY vaults. In the Arcadia review, he tested pooled interest-bearing shares for correct flash lending logic and single-collateral handling, catching reentrancy bugs. For Teller Finance, he analyzed its loan vaults to ensure loans cannot undercollateralize vault share value. He also examined MaxAPY vaults to verify that user deposits mint the right number of ERC-4626 shares and that continuous yield accrual is enforced correctly.
- **ERC-7540 vaults:** Specialized in Superform’s ERC-7540-based vault core. He led the audit of **Superform V2’s core architecture**, which uses asynchronous yield conversion, ensuring its indexing math and withdrawal queue logic function as intended. His review confirmed that Superform’s yield-bearing tokens (representing staked positions) correctly rebalance value over time and that liquidity can be added or removed safely without desyncing share price.
- **RWA tokenization:** While focused on on-chain vaults, he applies insights toward real-world assets. He has not publicly audited an RWA token, but his work on stablecoin-backed vaults (like Teller and Arcadia) provides experience relevant to RWA. He stays informed on RWA trends and is prepared to apply his vault-analysis expertise to ensure any tokenized off-chain asset system adheres to its specifications.

Centrifuge,hyh,"hyh is a highly experienced smart-contract security auditor known for identifying complex vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols. He has led multiple audits on the Sherlock platform and related contests, consistently finding critical issues in token bridges, vault mechanisms, and lending systems. His strengths include deep technical understanding of token accounting and cross-chain logic, allowing him to spot subtle bugs in multi-chain and vault-based designs. With extensive experience across share-based vaults and cross-chain modules, he is well-suited to audit Centrifuge V3’s complex vault and messaging features.
- **Cross-chain messaging & bridging:** hyh has audited multi-chain protocols and bridges in depth. In the Sherlock audit of TapiocaDAO (a cross-chain lending/rollup platform), he discovered serious flaws in the TOFT bridge modules – for example, missing transformations on cross-chain deposit/lock and insecure MarketReceiver hooks – demonstrating mastery of bridge mechanics. He also found integration bugs in a LI.FI (cross-chain swap/bridge aggregator) contest, such as a CBridge adapter that mishandles native token transfers and incorrect `msg.value` handling during swaps. These examples show his expertise in scrutinizing cross-chain messaging flows and bridging logic.
- **ERC-4626 share vaults:** hyh has strong expertise in tokenized vault standards. For instance, in the audit of Sentiment (an ERC-4626 shares vault), he identified key issues in vault accounting – including an incorrect Uniswap-based price oracle and a vulnerability where the first depositor could depress the vault’s share value. He has also uncovered classic “first-depositor” share inflation bugs in other share-based vaults (e.g. in Badger’s StakedCitadel and Yearn v2 yVault), which would allow an early user to manipulate share denominations. This track record shows his deep grasp of ERC-4626-style vault logic and safeguards against share-price manipulation.
- **Asynchronous vault patterns (e.g. ERC-7540):** hyh is familiar with complex multi-step vault designs and reward buffers. In the Alchemix Transmuter audit, he found multiple logic flaws – such as a case where the very first depositor could depress the newly-minted gALCX token value, and mis-specified slippage in the TransmuterBuffer that could lock funds. He also spotted an issue in a leveraged SuperVault design where a stuck “leverageSwap” operation could freeze user funds, and he identified yield distribution bugs in Lido and Convex LP vaults (during a Sturdy Finance audit). These findings demonstrate his capability to analyze asynchronous reward and withdrawal mechanisms similar to ERC-7540 vault patterns."

MegaETH,[**Mantle**](https://www.mantle.xyz/),"- **What has been audited:**
- **Mantle Skadi Hardfork:** A comprehensive audit of Mantle's core client, a modified `op-geth` fork. The scope included major architectural changes such as a restructured fee model, native MNT token integration, and a new preconfirmation mechanism.
- **OP Succinct Integration:** An audit of the integration of a ZK-based finality solution into the OP Stack. This focused on the new `op-succinct-proposer` service, which orchestrates the ZK proving pipeline, and the on-chain contracts that verify proofs to finalize the L2 state.
- **Why is it relevant for MegaETH:**
- **Direct OP Stack + ZK Prover Experience:** This audit is directly analogous to MegaETH's architecture. Our experience with the `op-succinct-proposer` and its on-chain verifier gives us firsthand insight into the security risks of integrating a ZK-based prover (like RISC Zero) into the OP Stack's fault-proof interface.
- **Some Notable Findings:**
- **Permanent L2 Block Loss Due to DA Failure:** A critical state management bug was found in the data submission logic. When DA submission failed repeatedly, a `reset()` function was triggered that permanently destroyed processed L2 blocks from memory without a recovery mechanism, leading to data loss and halting the batching process."
MegaETH,[**Irys**](https://irys.xyz/),"- **What has been audited:**
- A comprehensive audit of the Irys execution layer, a custom, high-performance client written in Rust. The scope included a deep review of core logic, state validation, and network interactions, with a specific focus on components and design patterns borrowed from **Reth**.

We are intimately familiar with the security challenges of integrating Reth components into a custom client and ensuring the correctness of the surrounding logic.
- **Some Notable Findings:**
- **Integer Underflow DoS in Merkle Path Validation:** A critical vulnerability was discovered where a malformed Merkle proof sent by an attacker could trigger an integer underflow. This would cause the node to panic and crash, allowing for a simple and effective Denial of Service attack against the network.
- **Missing Block Validation Checks:** The client's block validation logic failed to check several critical fields, such as `evm_block_hash` and `previous_solution_hash`. This could allow the network to accept invalid blocks, leading to a potential chain split or the acceptance of a fraudulent state."
MegaETH,[**Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) Bedrock (OP-Stack)**,"- **What has been audited:**
- A full-stack audit of the foundational Optimism Bedrock upgrade. The scope covered all core off-chain components, including the execution client (`op-geth`) and the consensus client (`op-node`), as well as all on-chain components like the L1 settlement contracts and the L2 predeploys.
- **Why is it relevant for MegaETH:**
- **Fundamental OP Stack Expertise:** Since MegaETH is built on the OP Stack, our deep audit of its core architecture is fundamentally relevant. Our auditors have an intimate understanding of the design patterns, security assumptions, and potential failure points of the stack MegaETH is building upon.
- **Some Notable Findings:**
- **P2P Spam Can Permanently Brick Nodes:** A critical DoS vulnerability was found where an attacker could replay old L2 blocks to a node. This would pollute the node's cache of ""seen"" blocks, causing it to reject new, valid blocks as ""too old,"" permanently preventing it from syncing with the rest of the network.
- **Incorrect Frame Decoding Leading to Consensus Split:** A critical bug in the batcher's decoding logic was discovered. The implementation failed to correctly validate the `is_last` flag in a data frame, allowing it to accept malformed frames that a spec-compliant node would reject. A malicious sequencer could exploit this to cause a consensus split between different client implementations.

![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)
From our conversations and the documentation provided, we understand that the MegaETH audit covers several highly specialized, low-level components. The security of the entire system relies on the correctness of a new cryptographic data structure, a custom execution validator, and a novel integration of ZK fault proofs.
Standard auditing expertise is not sufficient here. Therefore, we have selected a team of auditors based on their proven, hands-on experience in the specific, advanced domains that match your technical stack. To summarize, we've focused on auditors who are leaders in these 4 areas:
- **Deep Cryptography Expertise:** Essential for auditing SALT. We've selected auditors with a strong background in cryptography to rigorously analyze the new state trie implementation and its underlying mathematical assumptions.
- **Ethereum Execution Client & Node Software (Rust):** Required for the Stateless Validator. Our chosen auditors are deeply familiar with Ethereum node architecture, specifically Rust-based clients like Reth, ensuring they can effectively validate your re-execution logic and its interfaces.
- **L2 Architecture / OP Stack & ZK Fault Proofs:** Crucial for the OP Stack modifications. The team has direct experience with L2 architecture, the OP Stack, and ZK-based fault proof systems like Risk0, which is critical for verifying the integration and custom changes to Kailua.
- **Low-Level EVM Knowledge:** A non-negotiable for this audit. The auditors selected have a track record of working with the EVM at a deep level, which is necessary to assess the security implications of your gas accounting modifications and the replacement of the state root calculation.

bauchibred's work on Beanstalk protocol (2nd place finish) revealed critical issues in wstETH pricing conditions, demonstrating deep understanding of rebasing token mechanics that directly translate to Molecula's wrapped rebase assets.
Similarly in Sophon Contracts (2nd place), he identified high-severity vulnerability rooted in flawed assumptions around stETH transfer amounts.
In Renzo audit (3rd place), he recognized a critical issue of how LST price movements can result in value being lost to MEV."
Molecula (Wrapped Rebase Asset),**4. monrel**,"**Background**: Top security researcher who has demonstrated a strong ability to find high-impact, solo vulnerabilities in competitive audits
**Achievements**
- 2x 1st place, 2x 2nd place, 2x 3rd place finishes in competitive audits
- $125.30K+ in total earnings
- Audited Taiko (Rank #1), Rio Network, Aegis.im YUSD, LoopFi, Symmio, Asymmetry
- Found critical high-impact solo vulnerabilities in protocols like Taiko (a based rollup protocol) and BlendV2.
**Why He is a Good Fit**
monrel uncovered a critical issue in the audit of Asymmetry (protocol to help diversify and decentralize liquid staking derivatives) where assumptions around stETH pegged to ETH would have resulted in users getting blocked from withdrawals and opening doors to sandwich attacks - such expertise would fit well while auditing Molecula's rebase assets mechanics.
In Rio Liquid Restaking Network audit, monrel logged a solo vulnerability which would have resulted in users unfairly paying penalties under certain conditions. This emphasizes his deep understanding of the codebase and his knack of spotting unique findings."
Molecula,Tapir,"**Experience:** Tapir is a senior Sherlock researcher focused on yield vaults and reward-distribution math. He uncovered three High-severity fee-drift bugs in **Burve’s single-sided liquidity vaults**, exposed leverage-limit and tick-math flaws in **Yielddoor’s leveraged AMM**, and delivered nine findings (six High) in **Rio Network’s LRT restaking module**, covering withdrawal queues, share-price rounding, and reward caps. This track record shows deep skill in vault accounting, rebase logic, and incentive alignment across diverse yield systems.
**Why he is a good fit:** Molecula’s SupplyManager V2, rebase tokens, and ERC-4626-style vaults rely on precise fee, reward, and share-price calculations—exactly the areas where Tapir has repeatedly found critical issues. His experience with tax distribution, withdrawal-fee bypasses, and reward-bearing share dilution equips him to validate Molecula’s vault math, rebase controller, and native/ERC-20 token integrations."
Molecula,Pyro (0x3b),"**Experience**
Pyro focuses on reward-bearing tokens, rebase mechanisms, and leveraged vault flows. He identified three High-severity reward-drift issues in **Burve**, leverage accounting bugs in **Yielddoor**, and nine critical and medium findings in **Rio Network’s** share-price and withdrawal logic. His earlier work on **Pareto USP** and **vVv Launchpad** further sharpened his understanding of deposit caps, reward splitting, and dynamic fee models.
**Why he is a good fit**
Molecula’s rebase tokens and multi-asset vault suite demand airtight reward distribution and share-price safety. Pyro’s success pinpointing rebase-drift, leverage mis-calculation, and fee-skimming vectors makes him ideal for stress-testing Molecula’s BaseTokenVault, YieldLogic library, and RewardBearingToken contract."
Molecula,Vinica_boy,"**Experience:** vinica\_boy excels at vault-based yield and liquidity systems. In *Liquidity Management* he delivered **11 findings**—three High-severity—on leveraged vault deposits, PnL withdrawal math, and share-allocation accuracy. He later uncovered accounting drift in *Aegis im YUSD* and a Medium-severity vault-sync flaw in *Symbiotic core*. Most recently, he joined Sherlock’s *Maple Finance* security review, analysing fixed-income vault flows and reward distribution logic.
**Why he is a good fit:** Molecula’s ERC-4626-style TokenVaults, rebase tokens, and reward-bearing vaults depend on precise net-asset tracking and withdrawal safety. vinica\_boy’s record of exposing share-price errors, redemption edge cases, and cross-vault accounting issues positions him to validate Molecula’s yield math and protect users from dilution or loss."
Molecula,Samurai77,"**Experience:** samurai77 specializes in yield-generating vaults and leveraged position management. He took **1st place** in the *Size* contest, logging nine critical findings on liquidation math, collateral caps, and credit-market fees. In Sherlock’s *Sentiment V2* audit he uncovered eight ERC-4626 compliance and oracle-price edge cases, while his *Yielddoor* review exposed delayed liquidation math and multi-hop swap failures. Across these audits samurai77 has repeatedly identified nuanced accounting bugs, fee-distribution errors, and swap-path limitations in complex vault ecosystems.
**Why he is a good fit:** Molecula’s rebasing tokens, reward-bearing vaults, and leverage-enabled strategies mirror the mechanics samurai77 has already secured. His knack for spotting liquidation delays, withdrawal-queue flaws, and vault accounting drift will directly strengthen Molecula’s yield engine and protect user funds."
Molecula,Santipu,"**Experience:** santipu has a strong track record securing capital-efficient lending and reward systems. He uncovered nine medium-severity logic flaws in **Beraborrow’s vault-based borrowing layer**, exposed collateral-handling inconsistencies in a **Liquity-style CDP fork**, and flagged rounding-loss and DoS vectors in **Exactly Protocol’s staking upgrade**. These findings span withdrawal queues, interest accrual, and reward-token precision—core mechanics shared by Molecula’s supply manager, rebasing tokens, and multi-vault architecture.
**Why he is a good fit:** Molecula’s yield engine relies on accurate share accounting, rebase math, and secure reward distribution. santipu’s demonstrated ability to pinpoint vault accounting drift, fee-calculation errors, and staking-reward edge cases will directly enhance Molecula’s safety and protect depositors’ returns."

Comprising just 15 elite researchers, this team represents the top-performing auditors from a global community of over 10,000."
Morpho Markets V2 Audit Proposal,Our Understanding of Your Needs,"Morpho Markets V2 is introducing a sophisticated fixed-rate lending primitive to the Morpho ecosystem, featuring a new architecture designed to enable a different class of financial products.
• **Novel Fixed-Rate and RFQ Mechanics:** Markets V2 moves beyond variable-rate pools to a peer-to-peer model where fixed-rate loans are negotiated via a Request for Quote (RFQ) system. This introduces unique security challenges related to order matching, quote validity, preventing front-running of offers, and ensuring the economic soundness of the fixed-rate calculations over the loan's term.
• **Extensibility for a Builder Ecosystem:** The protocol is designed as a base layer for other projects to build innovative features such as auto-renewing loans. This architecture requires a security audit that also examines its extensibility, ensuring integration points are secure and cannot be exploited by third-party layers.
• **Economic Security and Incentive Alignment:** The success of an RFQ system depends on robust economic incentives for both borrowers and lenders. The audit must therefore focus heavily on potential economic vulnerabilities, such as oracle manipulation, incentive misalignment, or edge cases in the interest rate model that could be exploited.
Based on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of world-class auditors with specific, demonstrated expertise in these domains.
- **Expertise in Novel Financial Primitives:** Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is crucial for a novel codebase like Markets V2. The unique logic of an RFQ system is where creative, manual analysis uncovers critical vulnerabilities that automated tools would likely miss.
- **Direct Experience with Fixed-Rate and Intent-Based Systems:** Our researchers have direct, hands-on experience auditing the most relevant protocols. This includes leading fixed-rate platforms (Notional Finance), intent-based systems (Velodrome), and even previous versions of Morpho itself.
- **Focus on Securing Platforms:** Our deep expertise in securing modular, extensible protocols makes our researchers a great fit for securing a platform intended for other developers to build upon. We understand how to analyze a system not just for what it *does*, but for what it *enables*, anticipating how downstream integrations like Tenor's could potentially interact with and stress the core logic.
- **Proven Track Record in High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is set to become a foundational piece of DeFi infrastructure. Blackthorn researchers are specialists in conducting the final audit before mainnet for the world's largest protocols, finding the critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities that other teams miss.
![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)
Morpho Markets V2 introduces a novel architecture in which the Request for Quote (RFQ) mechanism is a critical and unique component of the design. Therefore, expertise in fixed-rate protocols and peer-to-peer systems is highly relevant.
Accordingly, we've selected some of the world's best DeFi researchers for this audit, particularly those with demonstrated experience in the specific domains required by Markets V2. To summarize, we've selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 3 areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Lending Protocol Expertise:** Direct experience auditing leading fixed-rate protocols like Notional Finance to understand the nuances of term structures and interest calculations.
• **RFQ and Intent-Based System Experience:** Proven ability to find vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer, intent-based, and order-matching systems.
• **Economic Vulnerability Identification:** A track record of finding critical bugs related to economic incentives, liquidations, and oracle manipulation in complex lending protocols.

MorphoV2,MorphoV2,"**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MorphoV2?**
Based on our conversations, we understand that Morpho Markets V2 introduces a novel architecture that is fundamentally different from previous Morpho iterations. This means general expertise in fixed-rate protocols and peer-to-peer systems is more relevant than direct experience with Morpho's variable-rate pools. We've also heard that the Request for Quote (RFQ) mechanism is a critical and unique component of the design.
With this context, we've selected some of the world's best DeFi researchers for this audit, particularly those with demonstrated experience in the specific domains required by Markets V2. To summarize, we've selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 4 areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Lending Protocol Expertise:** Direct experience auditing leading fixed-rate protocols like Notional Finance to understand the nuances of term structures and interest calculations.
• **RFQ and Intent-Based System Experience:** Proven ability to find vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer, intent-based, and order-matching systems.
• **Deep Morpho Architecture Knowledge:** Experience with Morpho's foundational layers, including top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.
• **Economic Vulnerability Identification:** A track record of finding critical bugs related to economic incentives, liquidations, and oracle manipulation in complex lending protocols.
****"
MorphoV2,Our Understanding of Your Needs,"Based on our conversations and analysis, we understand that Morpho Markets V2 is a significant evolution, introducing a sophisticated fixed-rate lending primitive to the Morpho ecosystem. This is not just an iteration, but a new architecture designed to enable a different class of financial products.
• **Novel Fixed-Rate and RFQ Mechanics:** We understand that Markets V2 moves beyond variable-rate pools to a peer-to-peer model where fixed-rate loans are negotiated via a Request for Quote (RFQ) system. This introduces unique security challenges related to order matching, quote validity, preventing front-running of offers, and ensuring the economic soundness of the fixed-rate calculations over the loan's term.
• **Extensibility for a Builder Ecosystem:** The protocol is designed as a base layer for other projects, to build innovative features such as auto-renewing loans. This architecture requires a security audit that not only validates the core protocol but also scrutinizes its extensibility, ensuring that the integration points are secure and cannot be exploited by third-party layers.
• **Economic Security and Incentive Alignment:** The success of an RFQ system depends on robust economic incentives for both borrowers and lenders. The audit must therefore focus heavily on potential economic vulnerabilities, such as oracle manipulation, incentive misalignment, or edge cases in the interest rate model that could be exploited.
Based on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of world-class auditors with specific, demonstrated expertise in these domains.
****
**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**
• **Expertise in Novel Financial Primitives:** Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is crucial for a novel codebase like Markets V2. The unique logic of an RFQ system is where creative, manual analysis uncovers critical vulnerabilities that automated tools would likely miss.
• **Direct Experience with Fixed-Rate and Intent-Based Systems:** Our researchers have direct, hands-on experience auditing the most relevant protocols. This includes leading fixed-rate platforms (Notional Finance), intent-based systems (Velodrome), and even previous versions of Morpho itself.
• **Focus on Securing Platforms:** Our deep expertise in securing modular, extensible protocols makes our researchers a great fit for securing a platform intended for other developers to build upon. We understand how to analyze a system not just for what it *does*, but for what it *enables*, anticipating how downstream integrations like Tenor's could potentially interact with and stress the core logic.
• **Proven Track Record in High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is set to become a foundational piece of DeFi infrastructure. Blackthorn researchers are specialists in conducting the final audit before mainnet for the world's largest protocols, finding the critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities that other teams miss.
**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MorphoV2?**
From our talks, we know Morpho Markets V2 has a new architecture that's very different from past versions. This means experience with fixed-rate protocols and P2P systems is more important than knowing the old Morpho pools. We also understand the Request for Quote (RFQ) model is a key part of the new design.
So, we picked auditors who are experts in the specific areas Markets V2 needs. We focused on auditors who are top-tier in four key areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Protocols:** Experience auditing protocols like Notional Finance, so they know the details of loan terms and interest.
• **RFQ and P2P Systems:** A proven ability to find bugs in peer-to-peer and RFQ-style systems.
• **Morpho's Architecture:** Deep knowledge of Morpho's core code, proven by top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.
• **Economic Security:** A history of finding major economic bugs related to incentives and liquidations in other complex lending protocols.
****"
MorphoV2,Our Understanding of Your Needs,"We see Morpho Markets V2 as a big step forward, creating a new kind of fixed-rate lending market. It's a completely new design meant to support new financial products.
• **New Fixed-Rate & RFQ Model:** Instead of variable-rate pools, Markets V2 uses a P2P model where users agree on fixed-rate loans through an RFQ system. This creates new security risks around order matching, quote validation, front-running, and making sure the loan math is solid.
• **A Platform for Builders:** The protocol is a foundation for others, like Tenor, to build new features on top, like auto-renewing loans. This means the audit needs to check the core protocol *and* how it connects with other projects, making sure those connections can't be attacked.
• **Solid Economics and Incentives:** An RFQ system only works if the incentives make sense for both borrowers and lenders. The audit needs to hunt for economic bugs, like issues with oracles, bad incentives, or loopholes in the interest rate model.
That's why we've put together a team of auditors who have proven experience in these exact areas.
****
**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**
• **Experience with New DeFi Concepts:** Our focus on deep manual review is perfect for a new codebase like Markets V2. The custom logic in an RFQ system has unique bugs that only a creative, hands-on audit will find.
• **Hands-On Fixed-Rate & RFQ Experience:** This isn't just theory; our team has practical experience with fixed-rate platforms like Notional, intent-based systems like Velodrome, and even Morpho itself.
• **Securing Protocols Built for Integration:** We're experts at securing modular protocols that are meant to be built on. We know how to look beyond the core code and think about how integrations like Tenor's could create new risks.
• **Track Record on High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is going to be a key piece of DeFi infrastructure. Our researchers specialize in that final pre-launch audit for major protocols, where they find the critical bugs that others have missed."
Napier - August 26 Team,**thekmj**,"**Achievements:**
- 6× 1st place, 2× 2nd place, and 2× 3rd place finishes in contests
- Over **$142.28K** in contest earnings
- Previously worked as a Pendle V2 smart contract developer.
- Notable engagements include **Napier v2 (#1 place)**, **Notional Update**, **MetaLend (Ronin Lending Protocol)**, **Covalent (#1 place, with oot2k)**
In **Napier v2**, thekmj was the **only auditor to uncover the sole High-severity issue** in the competition. That High exposed a **reward-distribution manipulation in YT**: a YT holder could inflate their **external rewards** by first claiming YBT yield, because distribution was pro-rated off **total YT supply** rather than a fair per-account accrual.
He also demonstrated sharp precision in the **Notional Update**, reporting a critical Balancer Boosted Pool integration bug that inflated thresholds and caused reverts—**the only researcher outside the Lead Senior Watson to catch it**.
In **MetaLend (Ronin)**, he was again the **only one to report both the single critical and the single medium**, including a reentrancy that created unliquidatable collateral positions and an OOG edge case causing unwithdrawable positions.
Finally, in **Covalent**, he uncovered multiple staking-reward flaws—epoch reward dilution, frontrunnable validator freezes, and stake bypasses—showcasing strength in complex reward-distribution logic."

**Why he is a great fit for Napier (yield tokenization)**
In **Usual V1**, he caught a reward-accrual bug and a math issue related to **incorrect withdrawal-fee calculation**. In **MagicSea (IotaEVM)** he exposed **unfair reward distribution** and governance/epoch quirks. His **ZeroLend One,** he found 9 bugs related to **index/share math and accounting, as well as a critical issue in which the curated yield could be drained from the vault.**
In **Flayer**, he identified **Uniswap v4/hook integration** bugs (comparison errors and unreturned native tokens). Add in **Size** credit-market issues (liquidator profit math, liquidity queries) and **Nudge** reward-disruption/unauthorized reallocation, and you get a consistent track record of catching exactly the accounting, distribution, and integration pitfalls."

Reflect,Vinicaboy,"**Experience:** Vinicaboy has extensive experience auditing decentralized exchange components and routers in Solidity. He participated in audits for AMM-based projects like Kyo Finance and Cork Protocol, where he uncovered critical flaws in swap logic. Notably, in Oku’s New Order type audit he identified an issue where a Uniswap-style swap function failed to reset token allowances, enabling potential fund draining. He has also flagged complex AMM bugs – for example, demonstrating how manipulated initial price ratios or unchecked liquidity additions could lock up pool funds.
**Why he is a good fit:** Vinicaboy’s track record shows a keen eye for the kinds of issues that a simple DEX router might have. He excels at catching logic mistakes and edge-case vulnerabilities in liquidity mechanisms. For instance, his finding of mismanaged approvals in swap routines and detection of locked-liquidity scenarios indicate he will spot token accounting mismatches or slippage errors in Reflect’s router. His focused expertise in DEX logic ensures a thorough audit of Reflect’s swap and liquidity routing functions."
Reflect,Demorex (TessKimy),"**Experience:** Demorex (TessKimy) has a strong background in auditing DEX routers and swap systems. He was a top participant in the MagicSea audit (the native DEX on IotaEVM), where he found dangerous flaws in liquidity handling – such as anyone being able to inject funds into another user’s position and missing failure checks that allowed token theft. He has also tackled router logic in cross-chain swap contexts (e.g. the eBTC Zap Router), catching subtle issues like improper handling of reverted ETH staking operations. This history underlines his familiarity with swap contracts and AMM mechanics.
**Why he is a good fit:** TessKimy is particularly suited to audit Reflect’s DEX router because of his knack for uncovering logic errors in swap and liquidity code. He has consistently demonstrated the ability to identify issues like unchecked token transfer results and improper access control in swap modules. With his experience finding edge-case vulnerabilities (for example, missing `revert` calls on failed token transfers or other router quirks), he will be adept at probing Reflect’s router for similar weaknesses – ensuring things like token balances, slippage safeguards, and liquidity accounting are implemented correctly."
Reflect,Oblivionis,"**Experience:** Oblivionis is a seasoned auditor who has tackled complex DeFi protocols, often those blending exchange and token mechanics. In Numa, he uncovered a critical vulnerability where an interest-bearing token’s exchange rate could be artificially inflated to steal funds. He has also contributed to audits involving DEX-like features and liquidity pools, bringing attention to how tokens are accounted and distributed. His findings in past contests underscore a deep understanding of token math and swap-related logic, even in hybrid lending/DEX systems.
**Why he is a good fit:** Given his background, Oblivionis is well-equipped to assess a Uniswap V2-style router. He excels at identifying subtle flaws in financial logic – for example, spotting an inflation attack in a token contract demonstrates his vigilance with accounting and conversion logic. This skill set translates directly to catching issues in a DEX router, such as re-entrancy in swap functions, incorrect reserve updates, or edge-case arithmetic errors. His attention to detail in past audits means he’s likely to catch any nuanced bug in Reflect’s router that could affect swap correctness or liquidity handling."
Reflect,Eeyore,"**Experience:** Eeyore is a highly accomplished auditor with extensive DEX experience. He has audited sophisticated AMM protocols like Velocimeter and identified critical issues in their core logic – for instance, he found that a rounding error in the invariant calculation for stable pools could allow an attacker to drain all liquidity from the pair. In another engagement for Predy, he discovered that one trading pair could steal another pair’s Uniswap V3 liquidity under certain conditions, showcasing his deep understanding of pool mechanics and arbitrage vulnerabilities.
**Why he is a good fit:** Eeyore’s proven ability to catch subtle bugs in AMMs makes him an ideal auditor for Reflect’s router. He has a sharp eye for logic errors that others miss – from miscomputed pool math to faulty access controls. For example, he has flagged a missing access control that allowed anyone to change a critical router address in a prior audit. With this expertise, Eeyore will adeptly scrutinize Reflect’s swap router for issues like faulty math in token swaps, liquidity edge cases, or permission mistakes, ensuring the router’s swap and liquidity routing logic is secure."

Side,**Gabriel Jaldon**,"*Exclusive to Sherlock*
**Experience:** Gabriel has led more than **ten flagship CosmosSDK audits** — most notably **ZetaChain’s lending + oracle modules**, where he uncovered 13 High bugs in collateral valuation, price feed aggregation, and **TSS** signer flows. In **IOTA Rebase** he traced Rust‑based liquidation math that mixed UTXO and account‑based state, closing rounding exploits that let borrowers evade collateral caps. He also hardened **Seda’s on‑chain oracle set**, catching stale‑price acceptance paths that could misprice loans.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s Cosmos lending, liquidation, and oracle pallets must maintain strict collateral ratios and signer consensus on prices. Gabriel’s track record finding over‑accrual, stale‑price, and signer‑nonce flaws equips him to test Side’s price feeders, liquidation triggers, and borrow‑rate paths—ensuring no borrower can dodge liquidation or exploit oracle drift."
Side,**Berndartmueller**,"**Experience:** Bernd’s 1st‑place ZetaChain contest win showcased deep dives into **CosmosSDK lending and cross‑chain liquidation queues**, where he fixed gas‑dependent liquidations that could be front‑run. In **Initia Rollup** he exposed EVM‑disguised messages manipulating oracle prices mid‑block, and in **Irys Datachain** he patched staking‑based oracle slippage that fed wrong collateral values to vaults. Across 15+ audits he has reported **40+ High issues** tied to borrow index mis‑calculation and liquidation auction logic.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s borrow, oracle, and liquidation modules inherit similar risks. Bernd’s experience spotting gas/price racing, collateral accounting drift, and auction‑freeze bugs positions him to validate Side’s liquidation hooks, ensure oracle price freshness, and lock down borrow index math under network stress."
Side,**Sammy**,"*Exclusive to Sherlock*
**Experience:** Sammy secured **Story Protocol’s lending & oracle layers**, detecting underpriced precompile calls that let attackers freeze liquidation queues. He later found non‑deterministic behavior in **CosmWasm price feeds** and a funding‑rate bypass in **LayerZero** that let borrowers over‑leverage. With seven Top‑2 finishes in 2024, Sammy has stress‑tested liquidation auctions, TWAP oracles, and borrow‑rate curves across $1.5 B TVL.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s Cosmos liquidator and oracle sets demand deterministic pricing and timely seize logic. Sammy’s knack for uncovering stale‑price DoS, cross‑chain data lags, and liquidation gas griefing will help bullet‑proof Side’s lending flow—from price ingestion to collateral seize—guaranteeing borrowers cannot abuse oracle latency or block‑gas limits."
Side,**Kuprum**,"**Experience:** As a former Informal Systems auditor, Kuprum has vetted **10+ CosmosSDK lending stacks**, including Critical findings in **Omni Network**’s IBC‑based oracle relays and **Lombard**’s liquidation licensing. He surfaced vault double‑counting in cross‑chain borrow logic and stale price acceptance in IBC feeds. First‑place finishes in **IBC Eureka** proved his ability to secure liquidation packet ordering and oracle timeout paths.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s lending, oracle, and liquidation folders hinge on correct IBC price propagation and seize‑collateral math. Kuprum’s deep Go‑level knowledge of bank modules, oracle feeders, and liquidation auctions will help confirm Side’s borrow caps, ensure liquidation packets cannot be delayed or replayed, and verify oracle tolerances keep LTV ratios sound under volatile markets.

Timeswap,**lemonmon**,"**Achievements:**
- 1× 3rd place finish
- From four Notional contests, consistently ranked between 3rd and 6th place
- Specializes in borrowing and lending, including fixed-term and fixed-rate mechanics
**Why lemonmon Is a Great Fit**
Lemonmon has repeatedly shown expertise in fixed-rate, fixed-term lending through strong performances in Notional contests.
His skillset extends to identifying critical flaws in lending protocols, as demonstrated by 5 High severity findings in ZeroLend One,
covering incorrect interest handling, debt share miscalculations, and liquidation logic issues.
He also uncovered 4 High and 4 Medium severity issues in Zivoe, including vesting-related vulnerabilities,
and precision/math calculation bugs such as the ZivoeYDL EMA error.
In addition, he earned 6th place in Tokemak—a lending/borrowing protocol—by reporting 7 High severity vulnerabilities, including reward token inflation, vault draining, and debt misreporting risks. His AMM-related work includes a High severity bug in DODO V3 allowing excess token minting due to accounting errors."
Tokamak,**KingNFT**,"**Experience:** KingNFT specializes in roll-up bridges and state-validation logic. At Sherlock he audited **Thanos L2’s native bridge for Tokamak**, uncovering a critical “incorrect address aliasing” flaw in `onApprove()` that could corrupt deposit traces. He also reviewed **Allora’s off-chain oracle network** and the **Optimism Bedrock upgrade**, focusing on cross-domain message hashes and proof-verification paths.
**Why he is a good fit:** Tokamak’s integrity-checker must guarantee that L1 storage updates match L2 commitments. KingNFT’s direct Tokamak bridge findings and Bedrock state-root work give him the exact context to test hash indexing, address-alias calculations, and replay-protection edges in the new verifier contract."
Tokamak,**Simao**,"**Experience:** Simao is Sherlock’s #2 all-time auditor with deep roll-up security expertise. He has audited **Arbitrum BOLD’s fault-proof pipeline**, **Fuel Network’s UTXO-style verifier**, **Base’s OP-Stack bridge**, and **Redstone’s on-chain oracle proofs**, repeatedly validating state-root derivations and commitment hashing.
**Why he is a good fit:** Tokamak’s verification contract mirrors the challenge mechanics Simao has already dissected in BOLD and Base. His track record of spotting mismatched commitment hashes, incorrect state-root serialization, and prover/validator race conditions ensures a meticulous review of Tokamak’s L1 integrity logic and any cross-layer edge-cases."
Toki,Eeyore,"**Experience:** Eeyore has audited multiple staking and reward distribution systems in DeFi. He reviewed Exactly Protocol’s staking module and Kwenta’s staking-rewards upgrade, where he exposed issues like a missing approval that could break reward harvesting and a griefing vulnerability that could strip users of earned rewards. Eeyore also caught critical flaws in token incentive mechanisms – for example, discovering an attack where an adversary could frontrun users’ reward claims in a token distribution contract (vVv Launchpad). He even identified edge cases in vault reward payouts (such as users’ rewards becoming irrecoverable in a vault’s claim logic), underscoring his expertise in staking and yield contracts.
**Why he is a good fit:** Eeyore’s track record shows a knack for finding logic pitfalls in staking and reward systems similar to Toki’s. His experience pinpointing vulnerabilities in reward calculations and distribution (harvest failures, claim frontrunning, lost rewards, etc.) means he is well-equipped to audit Toki’s staking, reward distributor, and token logic, ensuring no user can exploit the staking or incentive mechanisms as he has seen in past audits."
Toki,Oblivionis,"**Experience:** Oblivionis has direct audit experience with staking, yield, and token distribution contracts. He audited **Infrared Finance’s liquid staking protocol**, dealing with innovative staking reward flows on Berachain, and uncovered a severe token inflation exploit in **Numa’s yield platform** (a Compound-style cToken attack that allowed stealing the first depositor’s funds by inflating exchange rates). He has also contributed to audits of complex DeFi lending and incentive systems (including Aave v3.3 and Perennial’s rewards module), demonstrating his ability to spot vulnerabilities in interest accrual and reward distribution logic. Notably, his finding of a cToken inflation attack highlights keen insight into token reward mechanics.
**Why he is a good fit:** Given Toki’s focus on staking and reward distribution, Oblivionis’s experience is highly aligned. He has vetted liquid staking designs and reward mechanisms, identifying issues like inflation attacks and mis-accounted rewards in prior audits. This background equips him to scrutinize Toki’s staking contracts and incentive distributors for similar flaws, ensuring robust reward logic and secure token distribution."
Toki,Demorex (TessKimy),"**Experience:** Demorex has a strong background in finding flaws in staking rewards and token incentive logic. He has repeatedly uncovered vulnerabilities in reward distribution systems – for instance, he found an exploit in **vVv Launchpad’s token distribution** where an attacker could steal project tokens by frontrunning user claims. In a yield vault audit (Burve), he identified a broken reward calculation mechanism that could misallocate or overflow rewards. He also flagged issues in lending/staking hybrids like **ZeroLend**, where he reported that liquidated positions could erroneously continue earning rewards and even described an inflationary “donation” attack on the reward vault. These findings illustrate his skill in dissecting complex reward logic and ensuring fair distribution of yields.
**Why he is a good fit:** Demorex is an ideal auditor for Toki’s staking and token reward contracts because he has a proven eye for edge cases in incentive and staking logic. His past discoveries of reward leakage, miscalculated payouts, and claim exploits mean he knows exactly what pitfalls to look for. He will be able to apply this expertise to Toki’s staking, distributor, and token code, ensuring the staking and reward mechanics cannot be abused or bypassed."
Toki,Vinicaboy,"**Experience:** Vinicaboy has audited a range of protocols with complex reward and token distribution schemes. He demonstrated sharp insight in the **Gamma Brevis Rewarder** audit, where he found a high-severity bug that prevented users from claiming staking rewards across multiple epochs. He has also tackled stablecoin and lending reward logic; for example, in the Aegis YUSD audit he uncovered an invariant break where redemptions could leave tokens unbacked, highlighting his attention to correct token accounting. Additionally, Vinicaboy has contributed to security reviews of lending yield platforms like Maple Finance, giving him familiarity with interest distribution and incentive alignment. Across various contests, he has identified issues from reward-claim omissions to misaccounted yields, proving his strength in this domain.
**Why he is a good fit:** Toki’s staking and reward distribution contracts would benefit from Vinicaboy’s focused experience in this area. He has a track record of catching reward mechanism failures (such as unclaimable rewards and improper token accounting), which directly aligns with the needs of reviewing Toki’s staking, distributor, and token logic. Vinicaboy’s eye for detail in incentive systems will help ensure Toki’s staking and reward distribution is robust, with no loopholes for rewards to be lost or mis-awarded."

Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,"![Intro cover.png](Intro_cover.png)
![S2 (22).png](S2_(22).png)
Sherlock is the leading audit contest and coverage platform. In 2024 alone, we conducted 155 audit competitions, more than any other contest platform. Sherlock competitions consistently uncover bugs that other auditors miss, thanks to our unique model that combines the rigor of a traditional manual audit with the broad participation and incentivization of an audit contest.
The effectiveness of Sherlock’s model has been demonstrated even with the most battle-tested codebases in crypto, such as Aave V3. In January 2025, during the [Aave V3.3](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/747?filter=questions) competition, one of Sherlock’s Lead Auditors identified two previously undiscovered medium-severity bugs in the live codebase, despite multiple prior audits by other firms.
![image.png](image%201.png)
Blackthorn is an exclusive security firm incubated by Sherlock, dedicated to protecting the most critical codebases using the expertise of the most accomplished researchers in the field. The team works exclusively with top-tier organizations in Web3, including the Ethereum Foundation, Aave, MakerDAO, Optimism, Cosmos, and a select few others.
Blackthorn draws on the skills of a carefully curated group of researchers who have consistently demonstrated exceptional performance in private audits and competitions. These individuals have uncovered high-severity bug bounties in well-established DeFi and infrastructure protocols. Comprising just 15 elite researchers, this team represents the top-performing auditors from a global community of over 10,000."
Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,Our Understanding of Your Needs,"Based on our past conversations, we understand that Aave V4 is an ambitious evolution of past Aave protocols created to enhance modularity, reduce governance overhead, optimize capital efficiency, and integrate innovations such as GHO more seamlessly.
Unlike the past 3 versions of Aave, Aave V4 has a completely new architecture with a scalable and modular design. Because of this, auditors with strong overall DeFi experience may be more effective than those who are deeply familiar with Aave V3.
Aave V4 also includes decoupling liquidity management (Liquidity Hub) from borrowing strategies (Spokes). This architecture requires security researchers with strong experience auditing modular protocols and integrations.
We also understand that Aave V4’s equations and algorithms related to fees are quite novel and more math-intensive than previous versions. Researchers with strong math backgrounds and expertise with math-heavy protocols are important here.
Based on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of the world’s best auditors with these skillsets."
Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,Blackthorn’s Audit Methodology,"The centerpiece of Blackthorn’s methodology is an intense emphasis on manual review by the world’s best auditors, with a focus on finding Critical vulnerabilities that defy core protocol invariants. Our auditors augment this core foundation with proprietary, cutting-edge tooling, giving them the ability to find vulnerabilities that escape the human eye alone."
Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**1. Early Testing with Cutting-Edge Tooling**,"- Sherlock has built an industry-leading proprietary AI audit product (used in production with dozens of teams), which researchers use to find early vulnerabilities and insights.
- Researchers also use SAST & Symbolic Execution tools like Slither and Mithril to scan for common vulnerabilities and low/informational issues as a baseline."
Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**2. Manual Review: Deep Dive into Architecture and Logic**,"- **Architecture & Data Flow Mapping**:
- Researchers then analyze interactions between modules (e.g., Liquidity Hub ↔ Spokes) to identify invariant violations or unintended dependencies.
- Next, they map execution paths to ensure alignment with design goals (e.g., liquidity transfers, spoke-specific accounting).
- **Line-by-Line Code Review**:
- Researchers prioritize high-risk components (e.g., debt accounting, liquidation logic, fee algorithms) to design protocol-breaking attack paths
- They take an iterative approach to investigating complex logic:
- Cross-referencing developer intent (via comments/annotations) with actual implementation.
- Reproducing critical calculations in controlled environments to validate precision."
Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**3. Tactical Fuzzing & Validation**,"- Where appropriate, fuzz tests are created to stress-test critical functions and uncover edge cases in state transitions or mathematical operations.
- Test suites are often extended to cover edge cases and validate findings."
Updated Aave V4 Audit Proposal,**4. Reporting & Mitigation**,"- Blackthorn crafts structured reports including exploit steps, impact quantification, and targeted mitigation recommendations.
- Lead auditors work with the team during and after the audit to test fixes and ensure secure mitigations.
- Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is well-suited for a very novel codebase like Aave V4, as many vulnerabilities are likely to be unique and require creativity.
- Blackthorn’s deep expertise in cross-protocol DeFi integrations makes our researchers a great fit for securing a more modular intra-protocol architecture, such as Aave V4’s hub-and-spoke model.
- Blackthorn researchers’ backgrounds in advanced math, Symbolic Execution, and targeted fuzzing make them well-suited to finding vulnerabilities in Aave V4’s custom fee equations.
- Blackthorn’s deep history securing many of the largest and most unique DeFi protocols in the crypto space, such as Sky (MakerDAO), Symbiotic, Lombard, Babylon, Velodrome, etc. makes Blackthorn a great fit for securing a novel DeFi codebase like Aave V4.
- Aave V4 is expected to be one of the largest and highest-stakes protocols in the world, and Blackthorn researchers are well-suited to this assignment as they specialize in conducting the final audit before mainnet and finding Critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities in the world’s largest protocols that other audit teams miss.
![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)
Based on our past conversations, we understand that Aave V4 is completely different than Aave V3. This means strong expertise in DeFi in general may be more relevant than direct Aave V3 experience. We’ve also heard that Aave V4’s approach to fees (specifically the equations/algorithms) is quite novel and more math-intensive.
With this context, we’ve selected some of the world’s best DeFi generalists for this audit, particularly those with advanced mathematical backgrounds. Additionally, we’ve focused on demonstrated lending protocol expertise and experience with modular architectures. To summarize, we’ve selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 4 areas:
- Broad DeFi experience to easily understand Aave V4’s new design structure.
- Experience with math-heavy algorithms and interest models.
- Modular architecture expertise with a focus on hub-and-spoke architectures.
- Experience finding Critical issues in lending protocols, especially after previous audits.
