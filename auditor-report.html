**Great Fit:**
In **Peapods**, samurai77 surfaced high-impact issues including faulty LP accounting and vault inflation vulnerabilities, reward extraction via early withdrawal, flawed fee accrual logic, leverage adjustment errors, and asset-pair mismatches.
In **Yielddoor**, he uncovered a secondary position tick miscalculation that caused idle funds or missed fees, and a multi-hop swap loop bug causing OOG and broken functionality.
In the **Infrared** audit, he identified two severe issues, a scenario in wrappedVault where reward tokens matching the staking token would become permanently stuck due to missing rescue logic, a mapping-clearing flaw in MultiRewards::getRewardForUser() that could cause direct reward loss if a token transfer failed</div>

**Great Fit:**
He co-audited MetaLend Ronin (a Ronin-based lending protocol) and the *predict.fun* lending market, identifying key flaws such as unintended collateral seizure and repayment-blocking issues. He has also reviewed DODO’s Aerodrome integration and 40acres Finance’s veLending.
From **MagicSea**, he addressed issues such as incorrect reward distribution due to wrong call ordering and state-bypassing via unlocked positions.
In Acres 40, borrowers can exploit `pay()` by setting an `increasePercentage` to reinvest part of a repayment after the loan balance is zeroed, letting them withdraw more than actually repaid.

**Why they are a great fit:**
In Teller Finance, he uncovered a serious accounting error in `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` where the function used the original principal amount instead of the remaining principal to be repaid. This miscalculation could result in asset loss, especially when loans were partially repaid before defaulting.
He also identified a key vulnerability in a protocol’s `collateralFactor()` function, where the removal of a collateral asset from the list was not properly handled. This caused the system to underestimate total collateral value, leading to inaccurate risk assessment and unsafe rebalancing decisions.
In Mantrachain’s fee market module, he discovered a bug in the `ConvertToDenom` resolver function where the multiplier was incorrectly fetched using the base denom instead of `coin.Denom`. This caused conversion calculations to break for multi-fee-coin markets, potentially leading to incorrect fee charging.</div>

**Great Fit:**
0x3b has found H/M vulnerabilities in systems with vaults, lending/borrowing flows, and AMM-like reward models. In **Ethos Network Financial Contracts**, he addressed overflows in reward tracking, enabling reward over-issuance, as well as fee and buy price manipulations.
In **Teller Finance**, he identified a critical issue in burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings where shares were burned before principal-per-share calculations, artificially increasing share value and allowing users to withdraw more than their proportional entitlement, as well as he also found that the interest rate in LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart was derived directly from the current utilization ratio, allowing borrowers to temporarily deposit funds, lower utilization, take loans at artificially reduced rates, and withdraw their deposits.
In **NextGen**, he identified lending logic flaws allowing and under-collateralized borrowing.</div>

Sherlock is the leading audit contest and coverage platform. In 2024 alone, we conducted 155 audit competitions, more than any other contest platform. Sherlock competitions consistently uncover bugs that other auditors miss, thanks to our unique model that combines the rigor of a traditional manual audit with the broad participation and incentivization of an audit contest.
The effectiveness of Sherlock’s model has been demonstrated even with the most battle-tested codebases in crypto, such as Aave V3. In January 2025, during the [Aave V3.3](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/747?filter=questions) competition, one of Sherlock’s Lead Auditors identified two previously undiscovered medium-severity bugs in the live codebase, despite multiple prior audits by other firms.
![image.png](image%201.png)
Blackthorn is an exclusive security firm incubated by Sherlock, dedicated to protecting the most critical codebases using the expertise of the most accomplished researchers in the field. The team works exclusively with top-tier organizations in Web3, including the Ethereum Foundation, Aave, MakerDAO, Optimism, Cosmos, and a select few others.
Blackthorn draws on the skills of a carefully curated group of researchers who have consistently demonstrated exceptional performance in private audits and competitions. These individuals have uncovered high-severity bug bounties in well-established DeFi and infrastructure protocols. Comprising just 15 elite researchers, this team represents the top-performing auditors from a global community of over 10,000.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="auditor-description">Based on our past conversations, we understand that Aave V4 is an ambitious evolution of past Aave protocols created to enhance modularity, reduce governance overhead, optimize capital efficiency, and integrate innovations such as GHO more seamlessly.
Unlike the past 3 versions of Aave, Aave V4 has a completely new architecture with a scalable and modular design. Because of this, auditors with strong overall DeFi experience may be more effective than those who are deeply familiar with Aave V3.
Aave V4 also includes decoupling liquidity management (Liquidity Hub) from borrowing strategies (Spokes). This architecture requires security researchers with strong experience auditing modular protocols and integrations.
We also understand that Aave V4’s equations and algorithms related to fees are quite novel and more math-intensive than previous versions. Researchers with strong math backgrounds and expertise with math-heavy protocols are important here.
Based on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of the world’s best auditors with these skillsets.</div>

- **Line-by-Line Code Review**:
- Researchers prioritize high-risk components (e.g., debt accounting, liquidation logic, fee algorithms) to design protocol-breaking attack paths
- They take an iterative approach to investigating complex logic:
- Cross-referencing developer intent (via comments/annotations) with actual implementation.
- Reproducing critical calculations in controlled environments to validate precision.</div>

- Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is well-suited for a very novel codebase like Aave V4, as many vulnerabilities are likely to be unique and require creativity.
- Blackthorn’s deep expertise in cross-protocol DeFi integrations makes our researchers a great fit for securing a more modular intra-protocol architecture, such as Aave V4’s hub-and-spoke model.
- Blackthorn researchers’ backgrounds in advanced math, Symbolic Execution, and targeted fuzzing make them well-suited to finding vulnerabilities in Aave V4’s custom fee equations.
- Blackthorn’s deep history securing many of the largest and most unique DeFi protocols in the crypto space, such as Sky (MakerDAO), Symbiotic, Lombard, Babylon, Velodrome, etc. makes Blackthorn a great fit for securing a novel DeFi codebase like Aave V4.
- Aave V4 is expected to be one of the largest and highest-stakes protocols in the world, and Blackthorn researchers are well-suited to this assignment as they specialize in conducting the final audit before mainnet and finding Critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities in the world’s largest protocols that other audit teams miss.
![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)
Based on our past conversations, we understand that Aave V4 is completely different than Aave V3. This means strong expertise in DeFi in general may be more relevant than direct Aave V3 experience. We’ve also heard that Aave V4’s approach to fees (specifically the equations/algorithms) is quite novel and more math-intensive.
With this context, we’ve selected some of the world’s best DeFi generalists for this audit, particularly those with advanced mathematical backgrounds. Additionally, we’ve focused on demonstrated lending protocol expertise and experience with modular architectures. To summarize, we’ve selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 4 areas:
- Broad DeFi experience to easily understand Aave V4’s new design structure.
- Experience with math-heavy algorithms and interest models.
- Modular architecture expertise with a focus on hub-and-spoke architectures.
- Experience finding Critical issues in lending protocols, especially after previous audits.

            <div class="auditor-description">Sherlock's audit competition model combines the thoroughness of a traditional manual audit with the wide participation of an audit contest. It works by assigning **top-ranked security experts**, known as Senior Watsons, who are incentivized through fixed pay and an [ELO-style ranking system](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/leaderboards), to find as many bugs as possible during the audit. A significant prize pool attracts **700-1000 independent auditors**, who are paid based on the severity of their findings, focusing only on High and Medium severity issues.

            <div class="auditor-description">Sherlock is the leading audit contest and coverage platform. In 2024 alone, we conducted 155 audit competitions, more than any other contest platform. Sherlock competitions consistently uncover bugs that other auditors miss, thanks to our unique model that combines the rigor of a traditional manual audit with the broad participation and incentivization of an audit contest.
The effectiveness of Sherlock’s model has been demonstrated even with the most battle-tested codebases in crypto, such as Aave V3. In January 2025, during the [Aave V3.3](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/747?filter=questions) competition, one of Sherlock’s Lead Auditors identified two previously undiscovered medium-severity bugs in the live codebase, despite it having already been audited by multiple firms.
**Blackthorn – a team of the most accomplished and elite security researchers.**
Blackthorn is an exclusive security firm incubated by Sherlock and dedicated to protecting the most critical codebases using the expertise of the most accomplished researchers in the space. The team works exclusively with top-tier organizations in web3, including the Ethereum Foundation, Aave, MakerDAO, Optimism, GMX, and a select few others.
Blackthorn draws on the skills of a carefully curated group of researchers who have consistently demonstrated exceptional performance in private audits and competitions. These individuals have uncovered high-severity bug bounties in well-established DeFi and infrastructure protocols. Comprising just 15 elite researchers, this team represents the top-performing auditors from a global community of 10,000.</div>

- **Modular Architecture Experience**: Audited modular DeFi protocols (Index, Blueberry, Juicebox) and complex integrations (Pendle, Yield Bearing Assets), aligning with decoupled Liquidity Hub/Spoke design and granular parameter controls.
- **Liquidation Logic Mastery**: Specializes in uncovering edge cases in over-collateralization and liquidation flows (Reserve contest, Index contest), critical for ensuring Spoke contracts enforce safe debt accounting and liquidation thresholds.
- **Math Library Proficiency**: Experienced with WadRayMath-like systems in Pendle and Yield Vault integrations (Sense, Blueberry), directly applicable to interest rate models and fee calculations.
- **Access Control Validation**: Tested OpenZeppelin-based access control in protocols like NounsDAO DescriptorV3 and Hyperstable Core, ensuring patterns like AccessManaged and OnlyOwner are secure against privilege escalation.
- **Oracle & Risk Parameter Audits**: Analyzed price feed integrations (AdapterFi) and risk parameter updates in Yield Vaults (Blueberry), strengthening precision in dynamic DeFi environments.
- **Good Fit**:
Their track record in stress-testing lending protocols (Aave v3, Compound) and modular DeFi systems (Hyperstable, Index) makes them ideal for validating architectures with decoupled liquidity/borrowing logic, particularly liquidation mechanics, fee distribution, and cross-contract parameter synchronization.
- **30+ First-Place Contest Wins**: Including **Aave v3 integrations** (Index contest), **cross-margin perpetuals** (Syndr, Hubble Exchange), and **CDP stablecoins** (Hyperstable series), demonstrating versatility across DeFi primitives.
- **100+ Security Reviews**: Secured **$1B+ TVL** across protocols like **Iron Bank, OlympusDAO, and Kairos Loan**, with a focus on high-impact vulnerabilities (liquidation bypasses, reentrancy, governance manipulation).
- **Founding Security Researcher at Blackthorn**: Pioneered audits for complex DeFi systems, including **Pendle integrations** and **Yield Vault architectures**, now foundational to their expertise.
- **Private Audit Highlights**:
- **Hyperstable Core**: Identified critical flaws in CDP stablecoin logic impacting flashmint and perp lock mechanisms.
- **Blueberry**: Uncovered risks in staking and yield allocation tied to time-sensitive debt calculations.
- **NounsDAO DescriptorV3**: Validated NFT rendering logic under adversarial metadata inputs.
- **Key Audits & Skills**:
- **Lending Systems**: Iron Bank, Isomorph, Reserve, Index x Morpho.
- **Yield Vaults**: Sense, Rage Trade, **AdapterFi** (Pendle, Yield Allocator).
- **Options & Derivatives**: Buffer Finance, Dynamo, Volta.
- **Governance & Infrastructure**: FrankenDAO (Nouns fork), Plaza (market-driven perpetuals).
- **Notable Findings**:
1. **Index x Morpho**: Detected reentrancy risks in yield aggregation logic bridging Morpho and Aave v3.
2. **Hyperstable Flashmint**: Found a rounding error in debt calculation that allowed undercollateralized mints.
3. **Reserve Protocol**: Exploited a liquidation incentive miscalculation to drain reserves via arbitrage.
4. **Paladin (Curve Boost Fork)**: Discovered a governance timelock bypass enabling instant token minting.
- **Relevant Experience**:

**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MorphoV2?**
From our talks, we know Morpho Markets V2 has a new architecture that's very different from past versions. This means experience with fixed-rate protocols and P2P systems is more important than knowing the old Morpho pools. We also understand the Request for Quote (RFQ) model is a key part of the new design.
So, we picked auditors who are experts in the specific areas Markets V2 needs. We focused on auditors who are top-tier in four key areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Protocols:** Experience auditing protocols like Notional Finance, so they know the details of loan terms and interest.
• **RFQ and P2P Systems:** A proven ability to find bugs in peer-to-peer and RFQ-style systems.
• **Morpho's Architecture:** Deep knowledge of Morpho's core code, proven by top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.
• **Economic Security:** A history of finding major economic bugs related to incentives and liquidations in other complex lending protocols.

            </div>
            <div class="auditor-description">We see Morpho Markets V2 as a big step forward, creating a new kind of fixed-rate lending market. It's a completely new design meant to support new financial products.
• **New Fixed-Rate & RFQ Model:** Instead of variable-rate pools, Markets V2 uses a P2P model where users agree on fixed-rate loans through an RFQ system. This creates new security risks around order matching, quote validation, front-running, and making sure the loan math is solid.
• **A Platform for Builders:** The protocol is a foundation for others, like Tenor, to build new features on top, like auto-renewing loans. This means the audit needs to check the core protocol *and* how it connects with other projects, making sure those connections can't be attacked.
• **Solid Economics and Incentives:** An RFQ system only works if the incentives make sense for both borrowers and lenders. The audit needs to hunt for economic bugs, like issues with oracles, bad incentives, or loopholes in the interest rate model.
That's why we've put together a team of auditors who have proven experience in these exact areas.
****
**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**
• **Experience with New DeFi Concepts:** Our focus on deep manual review is perfect for a new codebase like Markets V2. The custom logic in an RFQ system has unique bugs that only a creative, hands-on audit will find.
• **Hands-On Fixed-Rate & RFQ Experience:** This isn't just theory; our team has practical experience with fixed-rate platforms like Notional, intent-based systems like Velodrome, and even Morpho itself.
• **Securing Protocols Built for Integration:** We're experts at securing modular protocols that are meant to be built on. We know how to look beyond the core code and think about how integrations like Tenor's could create new risks.
• **Track Record on High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is going to be a key piece of DeFi infrastructure. Our researchers specialize in that final pre-launch audit for major protocols, where they find the critical bugs that others have missed.</div>

He has contributed to Maple Finance’s loan pool reviews and audited cross-chain asset vaults, demonstrating deep expertise in DeFi protocols. For example, he participated in the Q2 2025 security review of **Maple Finance** and closely examined Autonomint’s omnicain vault design, showcasing his skill in validating complex token flows.
- **Cross-chain bridging:** Audited prominent cross-chain protocols like **Autonomint** and **Tapioca DAO**. For Autonomint, Simao verified its omnichain USDC vault, ensuring that funds remain secure when bridged across chains. He also reviewed Tapioca’s LayerZero-based TOFT vaults, identifying issues in the cross-chain messaging and collateral-handling logic to ensure tokens move safely between chains.
- **ERC-4626 vaults:** Reviewed interest-bearing vaults including Maple Finance’s loan vaults. In Maple’s audit, he analyzed how its pools mint and redeem shares against loans, checking that yield accrual and asset valuation follow ERC-4626 conventions. His work ensured the protocol’s deposit-withdraw accounting is correct, reinforcing secure interest distribution.
- **ERC-7540 / async vaults:** Worked with asynchronous vault models through loan vault mechanisms. In Maple’s loans, for instance, he examined how interest is recorded over time without synchronous rebase, ensuring that lending pools correctly track earnings and avoid accounting lapses. His findings helped validate that long-term yield is managed properly even when updates are not continuous.
- **RWA tokenization:** Engaged with early real-world-asset token concepts. He took part in auditing the **Crestal Network** protocol, which tokenizes off-chain assets, evaluating its on-chain payment and project-financing logic. This gave him perspective on how on-chain tokens can represent real-world collateral and cash flows.

            <div class="auditor-description">hyh is a highly experienced smart-contract security auditor known for identifying complex vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols. He has led multiple audits on the Sherlock platform and related contests, consistently finding critical issues in token bridges, vault mechanisms, and lending systems. His strengths include deep technical understanding of token accounting and cross-chain logic, allowing him to spot subtle bugs in multi-chain and vault-based designs. With extensive experience across share-based vaults and cross-chain modules, he is well-suited to audit Centrifuge V3’s complex vault and messaging features.
- **Cross-chain messaging & bridging:** hyh has audited multi-chain protocols and bridges in depth. In the Sherlock audit of TapiocaDAO (a cross-chain lending/rollup platform), he discovered serious flaws in the TOFT bridge modules – for example, missing transformations on cross-chain deposit/lock and insecure MarketReceiver hooks – demonstrating mastery of bridge mechanics. He also found integration bugs in a LI.FI (cross-chain swap/bridge aggregator) contest, such as a CBridge adapter that mishandles native token transfers and incorrect `msg.value` handling during swaps. These examples show his expertise in scrutinizing cross-chain messaging flows and bridging logic.
- **ERC-4626 share vaults:** hyh has strong expertise in tokenized vault standards. For instance, in the audit of Sentiment (an ERC-4626 shares vault), he identified key issues in vault accounting – including an incorrect Uniswap-based price oracle and a vulnerability where the first depositor could depress the vault’s share value. He has also uncovered classic “first-depositor” share inflation bugs in other share-based vaults (e.g. in Badger’s StakedCitadel and Yearn v2 yVault), which would allow an early user to manipulate share denominations. This track record shows his deep grasp of ERC-4626-style vault logic and safeguards against share-price manipulation.
- **Asynchronous vault patterns (e.g. ERC-7540):** hyh is familiar with complex multi-step vault designs and reward buffers. In the Alchemix Transmuter audit, he found multiple logic flaws – such as a case where the very first depositor could depress the newly-minted gALCX token value, and mis-specified slippage in the TransmuterBuffer that could lock funds. He also spotted an issue in a leveraged SuperVault design where a stuck “leverageSwap” operation could freeze user funds, and he identified yield distribution bugs in Lido and Convex LP vaults (during a Sturdy Finance audit). These findings demonstrate his capability to analyze asynchronous reward and withdrawal mechanisms similar to ERC-7540 vault patterns.</div>

These efforts have supported the advancement of Compound's infrastructure as a cornerstone of DeFi lending, with a focus on secure integrations, vulnerability mitigation, and protocol robustness.</div>

            <div class="auditor-description">- CometWrapper Development: Authored the initial version of the CometWrapper—an ERC20 token wrapper for Compound V3 that replicates cToken-like exchange-rate behavior to enhance compatibility and ease of integration. This initiative was executed under a Compound grant, streamlining user interactions with Compound III assets.
- Reserve Collateral Plugins: Engineered Reserve's collateral plugins for Compound V3, enabling secure collateral management and seamless incorporation into the Reserve Protocol ecosystem.
- Expertise and Validation: With more than 10 years of software development experience and specialized expertise in Web3 auditing (focusing on Solidity, EVM, and DeFi), Gabriel's proficiency in languages like Solidity, Rust, and Go has facilitated thorough validation of protocol upgrades. His impressive  track record of several audits in the last years further solidifies his expertise.
Complementing Gabriel's work, our security research team has extensively audited Compound V2 forks and analogous lending protocols, uncovering critical vulnerabilities to bolster overall ecosystem security. Notable achievements include:
- Deepr Audit (Compound V2 Fork): Top placements identifying medium-severity issues in interest rates and collateral flows, as well as high-severity findings on interest model drift.
- Numa Audit (Compound Fork): Exposing high- and medium-severity flaws in token accounting to strengthen liquidity and collateral handling.
- Metalend Audit (Compound V2 Fork): Validating lending architecture against exploits like collateral seizure, repayment denial, frontrunning, and exchange rate manipulation.
- Lend Audit (Compound-Based Contest): Top performances in Lend and other Compound-based contests, validating lending flows and cross-chain integrations.
- Additional Forks and Related Systems: Expertise in forks like Mach (focusing on interest and flows), Fraxlend (addressing global interest rate calculations), and Venus Isolated Pools (identifying vulnerabilities such as oracle drift and liquidation mechanics), preventing risks that could mirror those in Compound's models.</div>

- **Mantle Skadi Hardfork:** A comprehensive audit of Mantle's core client, a modified `op-geth` fork. The scope included major architectural changes such as a restructured fee model, native MNT token integration, and a new preconfirmation mechanism.
- **OP Succinct Integration:** An audit of the integration of a ZK-based finality solution into the OP Stack. This focused on the new `op-succinct-proposer` service, which orchestrates the ZK proving pipeline, and the on-chain contracts that verify proofs to finalize the L2 state.
- **Why is it relevant for MegaETH:**
- **Direct OP Stack + ZK Prover Experience:** This audit is directly analogous to MegaETH's architecture. Our experience with the `op-succinct-proposer` and its on-chain verifier gives us firsthand insight into the security risks of integrating a ZK-based prover (like RISC Zero) into the OP Stack's fault-proof interface.
- **Some Notable Findings:**
- **Permanent L2 Block Loss Due to DA Failure:** A critical state management bug was found in the data submission logic. When DA submission failed repeatedly, a `reset()` function was triggered that permanently destroyed processed L2 blocks from memory without a recovery mechanism, leading to data loss and halting the batching process.</div>

- A comprehensive audit of the Irys execution layer, a custom, high-performance client written in Rust. The scope included a deep review of core logic, state validation, and network interactions, with a specific focus on components and design patterns borrowed from **Reth**.
- **Why is it relevant for MegaETH:**
- **Direct Reth-based Client Experience:** MegaETH's re-execution client is built in Rust and borrows from Reth. Our audit of Irys provides direct, hands-on experience with this exact technical stack. We are intimately familiar with the security challenges of integrating Reth components into a custom client and ensuring the correctness of the surrounding logic.
- **Some Notable Findings:**
- **Integer Underflow DoS in Merkle Path Validation:** A critical vulnerability was discovered where a malformed Merkle proof sent by an attacker could trigger an integer underflow. This would cause the node to panic and crash, allowing for a simple and effective Denial of Service attack against the network.
- **Missing Block Validation Checks:** The client's block validation logic failed to check several critical fields, such as `evm_block_hash` and `previous_solution_hash`. This could allow the network to accept invalid blocks, leading to a potential chain split or the acceptance of a fraudulent state.</div>

- **Why is it relevant for MegaETH:**
- **Fundamental OP Stack Expertise:** Since MegaETH is built on the OP Stack, our deep audit of its core architecture is fundamentally relevant. Our auditors have an intimate understanding of the design patterns, security assumptions, and potential failure points of the stack MegaETH is building upon.
- **Some Notable Findings:**
- **P2P Spam Can Permanently Brick Nodes:** A critical DoS vulnerability was found where an attacker could replay old L2 blocks to a node. This would pollute the node's cache of "seen" blocks, causing it to reject new, valid blocks as "too old," permanently preventing it from syncing with the rest of the network.
- **Incorrect Frame Decoding Leading to Consensus Split:** A critical bug in the batcher's decoding logic was discovered. The implementation failed to correctly validate the `is_last` flag in a data frame, allowing it to accept malformed frames that a spec-compliant node would reject. A malicious sequencer could exploit this to cause a consensus split between different client implementations.

**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MegaETH?**
From our conversations and the documentation provided, we understand that the MegaETH audit covers several highly specialized, low-level components. The security of the entire system relies on the correctness of a new cryptographic data structure, a custom execution validator, and a novel integration of ZK fault proofs.
Standard auditing expertise is not sufficient here. Therefore, we have selected a team of auditors based on their proven, hands-on experience in the specific, advanced domains that match your technical stack. To summarize, we've focused on auditors who are leaders in these 4 areas:
• **Deep Cryptography Expertise:** Essential for auditing SALT. We've selected auditors with a strong background in cryptography to rigorously analyze the new state trie implementation and its underlying mathematical assumptions.
• **Ethereum Execution Client & Node Software (Rust):** Required for the Stateless Validator. Our chosen auditors are deeply familiar with Ethereum node architecture, specifically Rust-based clients like Reth, ensuring they can effectively validate your re-execution logic and its interfaces.
• **L2 Architecture & ZK Fault Proofs:** Crucial for the OP Stack modifications. The team has direct experience with L2 architecture, the OP Stack, and ZK-based fault proof systems like Risk0, which is critical for verifying the integration and custom changes to Kailua.
• **Low-Level EVM Knowledge:** A non-negotiable for this audit. The auditors selected have a track record of working with the EVM at a deep level, which is necessary to assess the security implications of your gas accounting modifications and the replacement of the state root calculation.</div>

            <div class="auditor-description">**Experience**
Pyro focuses on reward-bearing tokens, rebase mechanisms, and leveraged vault flows. He identified three High-severity reward-drift issues in **Burve**, leverage accounting bugs in **Yielddoor**, and nine critical and medium findings in **Rio Network’s** share-price and withdrawal logic. His earlier work on **Pareto USP** and **vVv Launchpad** further sharpened his understanding of deposit caps, reward splitting, and dynamic fee models.
**Why he is a good fit**
Molecula’s rebase tokens and multi-asset vault suite demand airtight reward distribution and share-price safety.

            </div>
            <div class="auditor-description">Morpho Markets V2 is introducing a sophisticated fixed-rate lending primitive to the Morpho ecosystem, featuring a new architecture designed to enable a different class of financial products.
• **Novel Fixed-Rate and RFQ Mechanics:** Markets V2 moves beyond variable-rate pools to a peer-to-peer model where fixed-rate loans are negotiated via a Request for Quote (RFQ) system. This introduces unique security challenges related to order matching, quote validity, preventing front-running of offers, and ensuring the economic soundness of the fixed-rate calculations over the loan's term.
• **Extensibility for a Builder Ecosystem:** The protocol is designed as a base layer for other projects to build innovative features such as auto-renewing loans. This architecture requires a security audit that also examines its extensibility, ensuring integration points are secure and cannot be exploited by third-party layers.
• **Economic Security and Incentive Alignment:** The success of an RFQ system depends on robust economic incentives for both borrowers and lenders. The audit must therefore focus heavily on potential economic vulnerabilities, such as oracle manipulation, incentive misalignment, or edge cases in the interest rate model that could be exploited.
Based on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of world-class auditors with specific, demonstrated expertise in these domains.
- **Expertise in Novel Financial Primitives:** Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is crucial for a novel codebase like Markets V2. The unique logic of an RFQ system is where creative, manual analysis uncovers critical vulnerabilities that automated tools would likely miss.
- **Direct Experience with Fixed-Rate and Intent-Based Systems:** Our researchers have direct, hands-on experience auditing the most relevant protocols. This includes leading fixed-rate platforms (Notional Finance), intent-based systems (Velodrome), and even previous versions of Morpho itself.
- **Focus on Securing Platforms:** Our deep expertise in securing modular, extensible protocols makes our researchers a great fit for securing a platform intended for other developers to build upon. We understand how to analyze a system not just for what it *does*, but for what it *enables*, anticipating how downstream integrations like Tenor's could potentially interact with and stress the core logic.
- **Proven Track Record in High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is set to become a foundational piece of DeFi infrastructure. Blackthorn researchers are specialists in conducting the final audit before mainnet for the world's largest protocols, finding the critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities that other teams miss.
![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)
Morpho Markets V2 introduces a novel architecture in which the Request for Quote (RFQ) mechanism is a critical and unique component of the design. Therefore, expertise in fixed-rate protocols and peer-to-peer systems is highly relevant.
Accordingly, we've selected some of the world's best DeFi researchers for this audit, particularly those with demonstrated experience in the specific domains required by Markets V2. To summarize, we've selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 3 areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Lending Protocol Expertise:** Direct experience auditing leading fixed-rate protocols like Notional Finance to understand the nuances of term structures and interest calculations.
• **RFQ and Intent-Based System Experience:** Proven ability to find vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer, intent-based, and order-matching systems.
• **Economic Vulnerability Identification:** A track record of finding critical bugs related to economic incentives, liquidations, and oracle manipulation in complex lending protocols.

            <div class="auditor-description">**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MorphoV2?**
Based on our conversations, we understand that Morpho Markets V2 introduces a novel architecture that is fundamentally different from previous Morpho iterations. This means general expertise in fixed-rate protocols and peer-to-peer systems is more relevant than direct experience with Morpho's variable-rate pools. We've also heard that the Request for Quote (RFQ) mechanism is a critical and unique component of the design.
With this context, we've selected some of the world's best DeFi researchers for this audit, particularly those with demonstrated experience in the specific domains required by Markets V2. To summarize, we've selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 4 areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Lending Protocol Expertise:** Direct experience auditing leading fixed-rate protocols like Notional Finance to understand the nuances of term structures and interest calculations.
• **RFQ and Intent-Based System Experience:** Proven ability to find vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer, intent-based, and order-matching systems.
• **Deep Morpho Architecture Knowledge:** Experience with Morpho's foundational layers, including top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.
• **Economic Vulnerability Identification:** A track record of finding critical bugs related to economic incentives, liquidations, and oracle manipulation in complex lending protocols.

            </div>
            <div class="auditor-description">Based on our conversations and analysis, we understand that Morpho Markets V2 is a significant evolution, introducing a sophisticated fixed-rate lending primitive to the Morpho ecosystem. This is not just an iteration, but a new architecture designed to enable a different class of financial products.
• **Novel Fixed-Rate and RFQ Mechanics:** We understand that Markets V2 moves beyond variable-rate pools to a peer-to-peer model where fixed-rate loans are negotiated via a Request for Quote (RFQ) system. This introduces unique security challenges related to order matching, quote validity, preventing front-running of offers, and ensuring the economic soundness of the fixed-rate calculations over the loan's term.
• **Extensibility for a Builder Ecosystem:** The protocol is designed as a base layer for other projects, to build innovative features such as auto-renewing loans. This architecture requires a security audit that not only validates the core protocol but also scrutinizes its extensibility, ensuring that the integration points are secure and cannot be exploited by third-party layers.
• **Economic Security and Incentive Alignment:** The success of an RFQ system depends on robust economic incentives for both borrowers and lenders. The audit must therefore focus heavily on potential economic vulnerabilities, such as oracle manipulation, incentive misalignment, or edge cases in the interest rate model that could be exploited.
Based on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of world-class auditors with specific, demonstrated expertise in these domains.
****
**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**
• **Expertise in Novel Financial Primitives:** Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is crucial for a novel codebase like Markets V2. The unique logic of an RFQ system is where creative, manual analysis uncovers critical vulnerabilities that automated tools would likely miss.
• **Direct Experience with Fixed-Rate and Intent-Based Systems:** Our researchers have direct, hands-on experience auditing the most relevant protocols. This includes leading fixed-rate platforms (Notional Finance), intent-based systems (Velodrome), and even previous versions of Morpho itself.
• **Focus on Securing Platforms:** Our deep expertise in securing modular, extensible protocols makes our researchers a great fit for securing a platform intended for other developers to build upon. We understand how to analyze a system not just for what it *does*, but for what it *enables*, anticipating how downstream integrations like Tenor's could potentially interact with and stress the core logic.
• **Proven Track Record in High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is set to become a foundational piece of DeFi infrastructure. Blackthorn researchers are specialists in conducting the final audit before mainnet for the world's largest protocols, finding the critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities that other teams miss.
**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MorphoV2?**
From our talks, we know Morpho Markets V2 has a new architecture that's very different from past versions. This means experience with fixed-rate protocols and P2P systems is more important than knowing the old Morpho pools. We also understand the Request for Quote (RFQ) model is a key part of the new design.
So, we picked auditors who are experts in the specific areas Markets V2 needs. We focused on auditors who are top-tier in four key areas:
• **Fixed-Rate Protocols:** Experience auditing protocols like Notional Finance, so they know the details of loan terms and interest.
• **RFQ and P2P Systems:** A proven ability to find bugs in peer-to-peer and RFQ-style systems.
• **Morpho's Architecture:** Deep knowledge of Morpho's core code, proven by top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.
• **Economic Security:** A history of finding major economic bugs related to incentives and liquidations in other complex lending protocols.

            </div>
            <div class="auditor-description">We see Morpho Markets V2 as a big step forward, creating a new kind of fixed-rate lending market. It's a completely new design meant to support new financial products.
• **New Fixed-Rate & RFQ Model:** Instead of variable-rate pools, Markets V2 uses a P2P model where users agree on fixed-rate loans through an RFQ system. This creates new security risks around order matching, quote validation, front-running, and making sure the loan math is solid.
• **A Platform for Builders:** The protocol is a foundation for others, like Tenor, to build new features on top, like auto-renewing loans. This means the audit needs to check the core protocol *and* how it connects with other projects, making sure those connections can't be attacked.
• **Solid Economics and Incentives:** An RFQ system only works if the incentives make sense for both borrowers and lenders. The audit needs to hunt for economic bugs, like issues with oracles, bad incentives, or loopholes in the interest rate model.
That's why we've put together a team of auditors who have proven experience in these exact areas.
****
**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**
• **Experience with New DeFi Concepts:** Our focus on deep manual review is perfect for a new codebase like Markets V2. The custom logic in an RFQ system has unique bugs that only a creative, hands-on audit will find.
• **Hands-On Fixed-Rate & RFQ Experience:** This isn't just theory; our team has practical experience with fixed-rate platforms like Notional, intent-based systems like Velodrome, and even Morpho itself.
• **Securing Protocols Built for Integration:** We're experts at securing modular protocols that are meant to be built on. We know how to look beyond the core code and think about how integrations like Tenor's could create new risks.
• **Track Record on High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is going to be a key piece of DeFi infrastructure. Our researchers specialize in that final pre-launch audit for major protocols, where they find the critical bugs that others have missed.</div>

In **Napier v2**, thekmj was the **only auditor to uncover the sole High-severity issue** in the competition. That High exposed a **reward-distribution manipulation in YT**: a YT holder could inflate their **external rewards** by first claiming YBT yield, because distribution was pro-rated off **total YT supply** rather than a fair per-account accrual.
He also demonstrated sharp precision in the **Notional Update**, reporting a critical Balancer Boosted Pool integration bug that inflated thresholds and caused reverts—**the only researcher outside the Lead Senior Watson to catch it**.
In **MetaLend (Ronin)**, he was again the **only one to report both the single critical and the single medium**, including a reentrancy that created unliquidatable collateral positions and an OOG edge case causing unwithdrawable positions.
Finally, in **Covalent**, he uncovered multiple staking-reward flaws—epoch reward dilution, frontrunnable validator freezes, and stake bypasses—showcasing strength in complex reward-distribution logic.</div>

Amow has shown consistent ability to uncover vault-bricking conditions, fee mis-accounting, and interest accrual flaws. He participated and found 2 criticals and one medium severity in Infinifi, which had Pendle integrations as well.
Found 20 criticals in RAAC - Core Contracts, he found 20 criticals including critical vault withdrawal mismatches and interest accrual failures due to incorrect scaling in RToken logic, which could desynchronize borrower debt and lender yield.
His Aegis.im YUSD work surfaced a redemption bug where unpaid fees directly degraded collateralization ratios, and mis-handling of rejected withdrawal requests.
Importantly, Amow also participated in Flayer Protocols, one of the rare public audits involving Uniswap v4-style architecture, where he reported 4 critical vulnerabilities.</div>

            <div class="auditor-description">**Experience:** Sammy is an accomplished auditor with multiple first-place contest wins and deep expertise in account abstraction, exemplified by his audit of Biconomy’s Nexus (an ERC-4337 smart account framework). He discovered a critical bug in Nexus’s smart account flow that could lead to fund loss.
**Why they are a good fit:** Sammy’s hands-on work with ERC-4337 wallets makes him an ideal auditor for Openfort’s EIP-7702 accounts. He understands session keys, user operations, and gas sponsorship, having identified pitfalls in those areas (e.g., a zkSync user operation vulnerability). With his broad auditing experience, he will rigorously assess Openfort’s session key management, bundler integration, and overall account logic to preempt exploits.</div>

**Why they are a good fit:** Having already exposed critical flaws in an account abstraction wallet, 0xdeadbeef is highly qualified to audit Openfort’s smart accounts. He brings deep knowledge of signature security, meta-transaction validation, and upgradeable wallet patterns to probe Openfort’s EIP-7702 implementation. Having identified replay and validation bugs, he will give special attention to Openfort’s session key constraints, delegated execution, and gas payment flows to ensure robust protection against attacks.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="auditor-description">**Experience:** Vinicaboy has extensive experience auditing decentralized exchange components and routers in Solidity. He participated in audits for AMM-based projects like Kyo Finance and Cork Protocol, where he uncovered critical flaws in swap logic. Notably, in Oku’s New Order type audit he identified an issue where a Uniswap-style swap function failed to reset token allowances, enabling potential fund draining. He has also flagged complex AMM bugs – for example, demonstrating how manipulated initial price ratios or unchecked liquidity additions could lock up pool funds.
**Why he is a good fit:** Vinicaboy’s track record shows a keen eye for the kinds of issues that a simple DEX router might have. He excels at catching logic mistakes and edge-case vulnerabilities in liquidity mechanisms. For instance, his finding of mismanaged approvals in swap routines and detection of locked-liquidity scenarios indicate he will spot token accounting mismatches or slippage errors in Reflect’s router. His focused expertise in DEX logic ensures a thorough audit of Reflect’s swap and liquidity routing functions.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="auditor-description">**Experience:** Demorex (TessKimy) has a strong background in auditing DEX routers and swap systems. He was a top participant in the MagicSea audit (the native DEX on IotaEVM), where he found dangerous flaws in liquidity handling – such as anyone being able to inject funds into another user’s position and missing failure checks that allowed token theft. He has also tackled router logic in cross-chain swap contexts (e.g. the eBTC Zap Router), catching subtle issues like improper handling of reverted ETH staking operations. This history underlines his familiarity with swap contracts and AMM mechanics.
**Why he is a good fit:** TessKimy is particularly suited to audit Reflect’s DEX router because of his knack for uncovering logic errors in swap and liquidity code. He has consistently demonstrated the ability to identify issues like unchecked token transfer results and improper access control in swap modules. With his experience finding edge-case vulnerabilities (for example, missing `revert` calls on failed token transfers or other router quirks), he will be adept at probing Reflect’s router for similar weaknesses – ensuring things like token balances, slippage safeguards, and liquidity accounting are implemented correctly.</div>

            <div class="auditor-description">**Experience:** Oblivionis is a seasoned auditor who has tackled complex DeFi protocols, often those blending exchange and token mechanics. In Numa, he uncovered a critical vulnerability where an interest-bearing token’s exchange rate could be artificially inflated to steal funds. He has also contributed to audits involving DEX-like features and liquidity pools, bringing attention to how tokens are accounted and distributed. His findings in past contests underscore a deep understanding of token math and swap-related logic, even in hybrid lending/DEX systems.
**Why he is a good fit:** Given his background, Oblivionis is well-equipped to assess a Uniswap V2-style router. He excels at identifying subtle flaws in financial logic – for example, spotting an inflation attack in a token contract demonstrates his vigilance with accounting and conversion logic. This skill set translates directly to catching issues in a DEX router, such as re-entrancy in swap functions, incorrect reserve updates, or edge-case arithmetic errors. His attention to detail in past audits means he’s likely to catch any nuanced bug in Reflect’s router that could affect swap correctness or liquidity handling.</div>

            <div class="auditor-description">**Experience:** Eeyore is a highly accomplished auditor with extensive DEX experience. He has audited sophisticated AMM protocols like Velocimeter and identified critical issues in their core logic – for instance, he found that a rounding error in the invariant calculation for stable pools could allow an attacker to drain all liquidity from the pair. In another engagement for Predy, he discovered that one trading pair could steal another pair’s Uniswap V3 liquidity under certain conditions, showcasing his deep understanding of pool mechanics and arbitrage vulnerabilities.
**Why he is a good fit:** Eeyore’s proven ability to catch subtle bugs in AMMs makes him an ideal auditor for Reflect’s router. He has a sharp eye for logic errors that others miss – from miscomputed pool math to faulty access controls. For example, he has flagged a missing access control that allowed anyone to change a critical router address in a prior audit. With this expertise, Eeyore will adeptly scrutinize Reflect’s swap router for issues like faulty math in token swaps, liquidity edge cases, or permission mistakes, ensuring the router’s swap and liquidity routing logic is secure.</div>

**Experience:** Gabriel has led more than **ten flagship CosmosSDK audits** — most notably **ZetaChain’s lending + oracle modules**, where he uncovered 13 High bugs in collateral valuation, price feed aggregation, and **TSS** signer flows. In **IOTA Rebase** he traced Rust‑based liquidation math that mixed UTXO and account‑based state, closing rounding exploits that let borrowers evade collateral caps. He also hardened **Seda’s on‑chain oracle set**, catching stale‑price acceptance paths that could misprice loans.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s Cosmos lending, liquidation, and oracle pallets must maintain strict collateral ratios and signer consensus on prices. Gabriel’s track record finding over‑accrual, stale‑price, and signer‑nonce flaws equips him to test Side’s price feeders, liquidation triggers, and borrow‑rate paths—ensuring no borrower can dodge liquidation or exploit oracle drift.</div>

In **Initia Rollup** he exposed EVM‑disguised messages manipulating oracle prices mid‑block, and in **Irys Datachain** he patched staking‑based oracle slippage that fed wrong collateral values to vaults. Across 15+ audits he has reported **40+ High issues** tied to borrow index mis‑calculation and liquidation auction logic.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s borrow, oracle, and liquidation modules inherit similar risks. Bernd’s experience spotting gas/price racing, collateral accounting drift, and auction‑freeze bugs positions him to validate Side’s liquidation hooks, ensure oracle price freshness, and lock down borrow index math under network stress.</div>

**Experience:** Sammy secured **Story Protocol’s lending & oracle layers**, detecting underpriced precompile calls that let attackers freeze liquidation queues. He later found non‑deterministic behavior in **CosmWasm price feeds** and a funding‑rate bypass in **LayerZero** that let borrowers over‑leverage. With seven Top‑2 finishes in 2024, Sammy has stress‑tested liquidation auctions, TWAP oracles, and borrow‑rate curves across $1.5 B TVL.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s Cosmos liquidator and oracle sets demand deterministic pricing and timely seize logic. Sammy’s knack for uncovering stale‑price DoS, cross‑chain data lags, and liquidation gas griefing will help bullet‑proof Side’s lending flow—from price ingestion to collateral seize—guaranteeing borrowers cannot abuse oracle latency or block‑gas limits.</div>

First‑place finishes in **IBC Eureka** proved his ability to secure liquidation packet ordering and oracle timeout paths.
**Why he is a good fit:** Side’s lending, oracle, and liquidation folders hinge on correct IBC price propagation and seize‑collateral math. Kuprum’s deep Go‑level knowledge of bank modules, oracle feeders, and liquidation auctions will help confirm Side’s borrow caps, ensure liquidation packets cannot be delayed or replayed, and verify oracle tolerances keep LTV ratios sound under volatile markets.

**Why Xiaoming90 Is a Great Fit for Timeswap**
Xiaoming90 placed 1st in 7 of 8 Notional contests, identifying reward re-entrancy bugs, fee path misconfigurations, and post-expiry rate flaws. Notional, like Pendle, operates in the fixed-term yield space, and Xiaoming90's work focused on time-sensitive accrual systems and maturity-driven accounting—core elements in Timeswap's own design.
Won 1st place in the Napier audit, a fixed-yield and tranche protocol with a strong time component. Found 15 accepted bugs involving yield miscalculation, decaying rate errors, exchange rate manipulation, and permissioned rebalancing edge cases—many of which map directly to time-decaying interest, principal-token logic, and curve-style AMM behavior.
Audited **DODO**, a math-intensive AMM combining proactive market-making and route optimization.

**Why panprog Is a Great Fit**
panprog has repeatedly delivered high-impact findings in protocols that blend lending mechanics with AMM-driven pricing—directly aligned with **Timeswap V3’s peer-to-pool lending, fixed maturity design, and oracleless architecture**.
In the Perennial series (1st in all 8 contests), he uncovered critical issues in margin logic, health calculation, and premature capital access—demonstrating an ability to evaluate borrower solvency, time-based payoff structures, and leverage boundaries.
His work on DODO’s AMM infrastructure further highlights his fluency with curve invariants, path-dependent execution, and liquidity provisioning assumptions—key elements in **Timeswap’s constant product-based AMM that matches lenders and borrowers across discrete maturities**.
With deep math expertise and top-tier audit results, panprog brings a sharp lens for evaluating **TBT (Time Bound Tokens)**, maturity-linked interest logic, and capital efficiency across Timeswap’s uniquely modular and oracle-free lending system.</div>

**Why hyh Is a Great Fit for Timeswap**
hyh placed 4th in the original Timeswap contest, surfacing a high-severity bug in the Y state’s interest rate logic—demonstrating early mastery of Timeswap’s maturity-driven borrowing model and custom AMM design.
He’s also uncovered critical math flaws in several top protocols. In **Ajna**, he identified miscalculations in LUP updates—specifically, how interest rate variables were biased by sequencing errors in debt penalties and liquidity movement. These findings revealed a nuanced understanding of how incorrect mathematical ordering in rate updates can distort long-term pool behavior.
In **Merit Circle**, he exposed a curve misalignment where `setCurvePoint()` altered the reward structure without recalculating the `unit` used in duration-to-multiplier math—resulting in distorted reward distribution from routine updates.
And in **Napier** (1st place), he flagged inconsistencies in tranche yield math, external fee-rate rounding, and time-based withdrawal flows—solidifying his strength in spotting errors in complex financial equations tied to yield curves and decay models.
hyh’s ability to detect deep mathematical inconsistencies—especially in systems where rates, time, and liquidity interact—makes him an excellent match for Timeswap’s fixed-maturity lending framework and precision-focused AMM logic.</div>

**Why 0xsimao Is a Great Fit**
0xsimao placed at the top in both Superfluid audits, where he dissected time-bound logic tied to unlock scheduling, tax buffering, and liquidity constraints. One notable finding exposed a math oversight in buffer logic: the funding buffer was underestimated when accounting for multiple low-rate flows. This resulted in a misaligned realtime balance and a failure to initiate essential flows.
0xsimao has also won Exactly protocol twice, a lending/borrowing with a fixed-term lending, where in one of them he found all 13 bugs, including 6 unique bugs and in the other contest, he got 11 bugs, including two criticals that were related to stealing unassigned earnings and a vault inflation attack. He had also participated in Morpho V2, again a fixed-term lending protocol that he found one of the few mediums related to a lack of slippage.
In *Autonomint Colored Dollar V1*, a deeply intricate borrowing protocol, he uncovered 28 high/medium-severity bugs, showcasing command over cross-contract state propagation, debt tracking, and liquidation edge paths, ideal for protocols with multi-layered accounting logic. In *Teller Finance*, he caught pricing drift from Uniswap pathing and multiple issues in loan commitment, auction curve behavior, and repayment misalignments.</div>

- Blackthorn researchers’ backgrounds in advanced math, Symbolic Execution, and targeted fuzzing make them well-suited to finding vulnerabilities in Aave V4’s custom fee equations.
- Blackthorn’s deep history securing many of the largest and most unique DeFi protocols in the crypto space, such as Sky (MakerDAO), Symbiotic, Lombard, Babylon, Velodrome, etc. makes Blackthorn a great fit for securing a novel DeFi codebase like Aave V4.
- Aave V4 is expected to be one of the largest and highest-stakes protocols in the world, and Blackthorn researchers are well-suited to this assignment as they specialize in conducting the final audit before mainnet and finding Critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities in the world’s largest protocols that other audit teams miss.
![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)
Based on our past conversations, we understand that Aave V4 is completely different than Aave V3. This means strong expertise in DeFi in general may be more relevant than direct Aave V3 experience. We’ve also heard that Aave V4’s approach to fees (specifically the equations/algorithms) is quite novel and more math-intensive.
With this context, we’ve selected some of the world’s best DeFi generalists for this audit, particularly those with advanced mathematical backgrounds. Additionally, we’ve focused on demonstrated lending protocol expertise and experience with modular architectures. To summarize, we’ve selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 4 areas:
- Broad DeFi experience to easily understand Aave V4’s new design structure.
- Experience with math-heavy algorithms and interest models.
- Modular architecture expertise with a focus on hub-and-spoke architectures.
- Experience finding Critical issues in lending protocols, especially after previous audits.

            <div class="auditor-description">Index.fun is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of custom indices, which are baskets of assets that track a particular market or strategy.
* The platform utilizes smart contracts on the Base blockchain to manage index creation, rebalancing, and trading.
* Key features include:
• Custom index creation: users can define their own indices using a variety of assets.
• Decentralized index management: smart contracts automate index rebalancing and management.
• Trading and liquidity provision: users can trade indices and provide liquidity to earn fees.
• Transparent and auditable: all index data and transactions are on-chain, ensuring transparency and auditability.
1. **`AccessManager`**: This contract manages access control for the binary market platform. It uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlEnumerable` contract to manage roles and permissions.
2. **`BinaryMarket`**: This contract represents a single binary market, where users can place bets on the outcome of an event. It tracks user bets, round results, and rewards.
3. **`BulkOracle`**: This contract allows an oracle (a designated role) to set the results of multiple binary markets in a single transaction.
4. **`IndexSlotRegister`**: This contract manages the registration of index slots, which are used to create new binary markets. It tracks the ownership of index slots and the associated market contracts.
5. **`PayToken`**: This is a mock ERC-20 token contract used for testing purposes.
The platform uses a modular design, with separate contracts for access control, market logic, and index slot registration.
*   The `AccessManager` contract ensures that only authorized users can perform certain actions, such as setting round results or withdrawing funds.
*   The `BinaryMarket` contract is the core of the platform, handling user bets, round results, and rewards. It uses the `AccessManager` contract to verify permissions.
*   The `BulkOracle` contract provides a convenient way for oracles to set the results of multiple markets in a single transaction, reducing gas costs and improving efficiency.

This means experience with fixed-rate protocols and P2P systems is more important than knowing the old Morpho pools. We also understand the Request for Quote (RFQ) model is a key part of the new design.\nSo, we picked auditors who are experts in the specific areas Markets V2 needs. We focused on auditors who are top-tier in four key areas:\n• **Fixed-Rate Protocols:** Experience auditing protocols like Notional Finance, so they know the details of loan terms and interest.\n• **RFQ and P2P Systems:** A proven ability to find bugs in peer-to-peer and RFQ-style systems.\n• **Morpho's Architecture:** Deep knowledge of Morpho's core code, proven by top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.\n• **Economic Security:** A history of finding major economic bugs related to incentives and liquidations in other complex lending protocols.\n****"}, {"protocol": "Axal", "auditor": "Our Understanding of Your Needs", "description": "We see Morpho Markets V2 as a big step forward, creating a new kind of fixed-rate lending market. It's a completely new design meant to support new financial products.\n• **New Fixed-Rate & RFQ Model:** Instead of variable-rate pools, Markets V2 uses a P2P model where users agree on fixed-rate loans through an RFQ system. This creates new security risks around order matching, quote validation, front-running, and making sure the loan math is solid.\n• **A Platform for Builders:** The protocol is a foundation for others, like Tenor, to build new features on top, like auto-renewing loans. This means the audit needs to check the core protocol *and* how it connects with other projects, making sure those connections can't be attacked.\n• **Solid Economics and Incentives:** An RFQ system only works if the incentives make sense for both borrowers and lenders. The audit needs to hunt for economic bugs, like issues with oracles, bad incentives, or loopholes in the interest rate model.\nThat's why we've put together a team of auditors who have proven experience in these exact areas.\n****\n**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**\n• **Experience with New DeFi Concepts:** Our focus on deep manual review is perfect for a new codebase like Markets V2.

As a DeFi generalist, he has consistently identified critical vulnerabilities that mirror the risk profile of the recent Malda exploit, focusing on edge cases in off-chain computation validation and cross-chain state synchronization.\n- **Cross-chain bridging:** Contributed to audits of LayerZero-based bridges and Axelar. On the **LayerZero OneSig EVM** module, he exposed a vulnerability in the relayer incentive structure that could allow temporary liquidity manipulation, directly relevant to Malda’s sequencer-proof workflow. In the **Axelar Network v2** audit, he flagged a race condition in token locking mechanisms, analogous to potential Malda extension chain withdrawal validation flaws.\n- **ERC-4626 vaults:** Audited yield vaults like Idle Finance’s credit vault and Pareto’s USP stablecoin vault. Uncovered rounding errors in share rebasing and reentrancy risks during redemption pauses—bugs that parallel precision and state consistency challenges in Malda’s global interest rate model.\n- **Batching / tranche vaults:** Specialized in batch-withdrawal designs (e.g., Idle Finance’s senior/junior structure). Identified state update reordering bugs that could exploit epoch transitions, aligning with Malda’s need to verify atomicity in batched proof submissions to Linea.\n- **Why They Are a Good Fit:** 0x52’s proven ability to reverse-engineer exploits from historical DeFi failures (e.g., relayer manipulation, epoch transition bugs) positions him to preemptively identify Malda’s critical attack vectors.

This introduces unique security challenges related to order matching, quote validity, preventing front-running of offers, and ensuring the economic soundness of the fixed-rate calculations over the loan's term.\n• **Extensibility for a Builder Ecosystem:** The protocol is designed as a base layer for other projects to build innovative features such as auto-renewing loans. This architecture requires a security audit that also examines its extensibility, ensuring integration points are secure and cannot be exploited by third-party layers.\n• **Economic Security and Incentive Alignment:** The success of an RFQ system depends on robust economic incentives for both borrowers and lenders. The audit must therefore focus heavily on potential economic vulnerabilities, such as oracle manipulation, incentive misalignment, or edge cases in the interest rate model that could be exploited.\nBased on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of world-class auditors with specific, demonstrated expertise in these domains.\n- **Expertise in Novel Financial Primitives:** Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is crucial for a novel codebase like Markets V2. The unique logic of an RFQ system is where creative, manual analysis uncovers critical vulnerabilities that automated tools would likely miss.\n- **Direct Experience with Fixed-Rate and Intent-Based Systems:** Our researchers have direct, hands-on experience auditing the most relevant protocols. This includes leading fixed-rate platforms (Notional Finance), intent-based systems (Velodrome), and even previous versions of Morpho itself.\n- **Focus on Securing Platforms:** Our deep expertise in securing modular, extensible protocols makes our researchers a great fit for securing a platform intended for other developers to build upon. We understand how to analyze a system not just for what it *does*, but for what it *enables*, anticipating how downstream integrations like Tenor's could potentially interact with and stress the core logic.\n- **Proven Track Record in High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is set to become a foundational piece of DeFi infrastructure. Blackthorn researchers are specialists in conducting the final audit before mainnet for the world's largest protocols, finding the critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities that other teams miss.\n![New Bug Bounty 15.png](New_Bug_Bounty_15.png)\nMorpho Markets V2 introduces a novel architecture in which the Request for Quote (RFQ) mechanism is a critical and unique component of the design.

To summarize, we've selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 3 areas:\n• **Fixed-Rate Lending Protocol Expertise:** Direct experience auditing leading fixed-rate protocols like Notional Finance to understand the nuances of term structures and interest calculations.\n• **RFQ and Intent-Based System Experience:** Proven ability to find vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer, intent-based, and order-matching systems.\n• **Economic Vulnerability Identification:** A track record of finding critical bugs related to economic incentives, liquidations, and oracle manipulation in complex lending protocols.\n![dead roses color.png](dead_roses_color.png)"}, {"protocol": "Morpho Markets V2 Audit Proposal", "auditor": "[**Deadrosesxyz**](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/bughuntoor)", "description": "**Lead Security Researcher, Blackthorn Member**\nLeading security expert with 23 podium finishes in Sherlock contests, and more than 20 accepted Bug Bounty submissions in DeFi protocols.\n**Achievements:**\n- Finished 1st place 14x, 2nd place 5x, and 3rd place 4x in audit contests.\n- Earned over $520K in audit contests.\n- Audited Aave V3.3 and V3.4, Velodrome, Beefy, Usual, Symbiotic, Euler, and 70+ other Top-Protocols.\n- 20 accepted Bug Bounty Payouts including Morpho, Velodrome (Critical), Beefy (3x Criticals), Across (Critical), Yearn, and others.\n**DeFi & Modular Architecture Experience:**\n- Intent-Based Lending Systems: Found bugs in the live code of Velodrome’s AMM hub and Morpho V1.\n- Crosschain Compatibility: Audited Across (hub-and-spokes) for settlement logic flaws and finality risks.\n- Fixed-Rate Loan Mechanics: Identified liquidation logic bugs in Wagmi Leverage V2 and rounding errors in Aave V3.\n**Lending & Math Experience:**\n- Reported a bug in the live code of Morpho, and audited lending protocols like Venus, Aave V3, Teller Finance, Beraborrow, Ajna, Iron Bank (1st place), and Wildcat Protocol (1st place).\n- First place in Wagmi Leverage V2, where he found vulnerabilities related to faulty liquidation logic ([https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-wagmileverage-v2-judging/issues/7](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-wagmileverage-v2-judging/issues/7)).\n![xiaoming90.png](xiaoming90.png)"}, {"protocol": "Morpho Markets V2 Audit Proposal", "auditor": "[**Xiaoming90**](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/xiaoming90)", "description": "**Lead Security Researcher, Blackthorn Member**\nLSR with 34 podium finishes on Sherlock.

To summarize, we've selected auditors who are the best in the world in these 4 areas:\n• **Fixed-Rate Lending Protocol Expertise:** Direct experience auditing leading fixed-rate protocols like Notional Finance to understand the nuances of term structures and interest calculations.\n• **RFQ and Intent-Based System Experience:** Proven ability to find vulnerabilities in peer-to-peer, intent-based, and order-matching systems.\n• **Deep Morpho Architecture Knowledge:** Experience with Morpho's foundational layers, including top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.\n• **Economic Vulnerability Identification:** A track record of finding critical bugs related to economic incentives, liquidations, and oracle manipulation in complex lending protocols.\n****"}, {"protocol": "MorphoV2", "auditor": "Our Understanding of Your Needs", "description": "Based on our conversations and analysis, we understand that Morpho Markets V2 is a significant evolution, introducing a sophisticated fixed-rate lending primitive to the Morpho ecosystem. This is not just an iteration, but a new architecture designed to enable a different class of financial products.\n• **Novel Fixed-Rate and RFQ Mechanics:** We understand that Markets V2 moves beyond variable-rate pools to a peer-to-peer model where fixed-rate loans are negotiated via a Request for Quote (RFQ) system. This introduces unique security challenges related to order matching, quote validity, preventing front-running of offers, and ensuring the economic soundness of the fixed-rate calculations over the loan's term.\n• **Extensibility for a Builder Ecosystem:** The protocol is designed as a base layer for other projects, to build innovative features such as auto-renewing loans. This architecture requires a security audit that not only validates the core protocol but also scrutinizes its extensibility, ensuring that the integration points are secure and cannot be exploited by third-party layers.\n• **Economic Security and Incentive Alignment:** The success of an RFQ system depends on robust economic incentives for both borrowers and lenders. The audit must therefore focus heavily on potential economic vulnerabilities, such as oracle manipulation, incentive misalignment, or edge cases in the interest rate model that could be exploited.\nBased on these needs, Blackthorn has curated a team of world-class auditors with specific, demonstrated expertise in these domains.\n****\n**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**\n• **Expertise in Novel Financial Primitives:** Blackthorn’s intense emphasis on manual review by world-leading auditors is crucial for a novel codebase like Markets V2. The unique logic of an RFQ system is where creative, manual analysis uncovers critical vulnerabilities that automated tools would likely miss.\n• **Direct Experience with Fixed-Rate and Intent-Based Systems:** Our researchers have direct, hands-on experience auditing the most relevant protocols. This includes leading fixed-rate platforms (Notional Finance), intent-based systems (Velodrome), and even previous versions of Morpho itself.\n• **Focus on Securing Platforms:** Our deep expertise in securing modular, extensible protocols makes our researchers a great fit for securing a platform intended for other developers to build upon. We understand how to analyze a system not just for what it *does*, but for what it *enables*, anticipating how downstream integrations like Tenor's could potentially interact with and stress the core logic.\n• **Proven Track Record in High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is set to become a foundational piece of DeFi infrastructure. Blackthorn researchers are specialists in conducting the final audit before mainnet for the world's largest protocols, finding the critical, protocol-breaking vulnerabilities that other teams miss.\n**How Has Blackthorn Selected Auditors for MorphoV2?**\nFrom our talks, we know Morpho Markets V2 has a new architecture that's very different from past versions. This means experience with fixed-rate protocols and P2P systems is more important than knowing the old Morpho pools. We also understand the Request for Quote (RFQ) model is a key part of the new design.\nSo, we picked auditors who are experts in the specific areas Markets V2 needs. We focused on auditors who are top-tier in four key areas:\n• **Fixed-Rate Protocols:** Experience auditing protocols like Notional Finance, so they know the details of loan terms and interest.\n• **RFQ and P2P Systems:** A proven ability to find bugs in peer-to-peer and RFQ-style systems.\n• **Morpho's Architecture:** Deep knowledge of Morpho's core code, proven by top performance in the Morpho Blue audit.\n• **Economic Security:** A history of finding major economic bugs related to incentives and liquidations in other complex lending protocols.\n****"}, {"protocol": "MorphoV2", "auditor": "Our Understanding of Your Needs", "description": "We see Morpho Markets V2 as a big step forward, creating a new kind of fixed-rate lending market. It's a completely new design meant to support new financial products.\n• **New Fixed-Rate & RFQ Model:** Instead of variable-rate pools, Markets V2 uses a P2P model where users agree on fixed-rate loans through an RFQ system. This creates new security risks around order matching, quote validation, front-running, and making sure the loan math is solid.\n• **A Platform for Builders:** The protocol is a foundation for others, like Tenor, to build new features on top, like auto-renewing loans. This means the audit needs to check the core protocol *and* how it connects with other projects, making sure those connections can't be attacked.\n• **Solid Economics and Incentives:** An RFQ system only works if the incentives make sense for both borrowers and lenders. The audit needs to hunt for economic bugs, like issues with oracles, bad incentives, or loopholes in the interest rate model.\nThat's why we've put together a team of auditors who have proven experience in these exact areas.\n****\n**Why Blackthorn’s Methodology and Expertise are Well-Suited to Morpho Markets v2**\n• **Experience with New DeFi Concepts:** Our focus on deep manual review is perfect for a new codebase like Markets V2. The custom logic in an RFQ system has unique bugs that only a creative, hands-on audit will find.\n• **Hands-On Fixed-Rate & RFQ Experience:** This isn't just theory; our team has practical experience with fixed-rate platforms like Notional, intent-based systems like Velodrome, and even Morpho itself.\n• **Securing Protocols Built for Integration:** We're experts at securing modular protocols that are meant to be built on. We know how to look beyond the core code and think about how integrations like Tenor's could create new risks.\n• **Track Record on High-Stakes Audits:** Morpho Markets V2 is going to be a key piece of DeFi infrastructure. Our researchers specialize in that final pre-launch audit for major protocols, where they find the critical bugs that others have missed."}, {"protocol": "Napier - August 26 Team", "auditor": "**thekmj**", "description": "**Achievements:**\n- 6× 1st place, 2× 2nd place, and 2× 3rd place finishes in contests\n- Over **$142.28K** in contest earnings\n- Previously worked as a Pendle V2 smart contract developer.\n- Notable engagements include **Napier v2 (#1 place)**, **Notional Update**, **MetaLend (Ronin Lending Protocol)**, **Covalent (#1 place, with oot2k)**\nIn **Napier v2**, thekmj was the **only auditor to uncover the sole High-severity issue** in the competition.
