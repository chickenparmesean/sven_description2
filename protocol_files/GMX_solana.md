# GMX-Solana-SRs


#### IllIllI

- **GMX Expertise**: IllIllI has extensive experience with GMX, having led the contest for GMXv2 and the GMX Update contest, scoring first place on both and identifying 16 critical vulnerabilities. He also participated in the initial GMX Solana audit engagement, where he found security issues due to small oversights in the porting of the Solidity code to Rust/Solana. This demonstrates his in-depth knowledge of the protocol and its potential security risks.
- **DeFi Auditing Experience**: He has also audited other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, including perpetual exchanges (e.g., Perpetual), Liquid Staking Protocols (e.g., FRAX, StakeHouse), and vesting protocols (e.g., Rio Vesting Network), showcasing his broad expertise in the field.
- **Why are they a good fit**: IllIllI's exceptional track record with GMX, combined with his experience auditing similar DeFi protocols and his broad skill set, make him an ideal candidate to audit the GMX Solana protocol, ensuring the security and integrity of the new implementation. His prior experience with the GMX Solana codebase also enables him to identify potential integration issues and areas that require more attention.

### bin2chen

- **Rust Expertise**: bin2chen is proficient in Rust and has scored multiple top positions in Rust-based audits, demonstrating his ability to effectively identify security vulnerabilities in Rust codebases. He applied this expertise in the initial GMX Solana audit engagement, where he identified high and medium severity vulnerabilities.
- **Audit Experience and Success**: He has participated in numerous audit contests, achieving impressive results, including scoring first-place four times, and identifying 11 bugs in the Andromeda contest. Additionally, he has found high-severity issues in contests such as EigenLayer and has a strong track record in competitions like zkSync, Astaria, Sentiment V1, and Illuminate.
- **Derivative Protocol Expertise**: In addition to his diverse protocol knowledge, bin2chen has also audited GMXv2 on Sherlock as well as other derivative protocols, including, Perennial, and Symmetrical, showcasing his ability to identify security vulnerabilities in complex financial instruments and mechanisms.
- **Why are they a good fit**: bin2chen's expertise in Rust, combined with his impressive audit experience & diverse protocol knowledge make him a strong candidate to audit the GMX Solana codebase. His prior experience with the GMX Solana codebase also gives him insight into areas that require more attention, such as module interactions and dependencies. His skills and experience, including his expertise especially in auditing derivative protocols, will enable him to effectively identify and report security vulnerabilities in the protocol.
