# Arbitrum Experience overview:

## Solidity

In the last 12 months, Sherlock ran more than 85 Audit Contests and 40 Collaborative Audits for Solidity codebases. These include a wide diversity of different DeFi protocols as well as some well-known names in the space, like Sky (former MakerDAO), Usual, and Aave. All audit contests can be seen at: https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests. Some major examples:
- [MakerDAO](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/333)
- [Usual V1](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/575)
- [Aave v3.3](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/747)
- [Mellow Modular LRTs](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/423)
- [Beraborrow](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/741)

Collaborative Audits:
- Nerite (LiquityV2 fork on Arbitrum)
- IVX

## Vyper

While the majority of EVM audits have been done for Solidity-based projects, we have audited several Vyper codebases as well, and have security researchers experienced in Vyper in our pool.

Vyper-based Audit Contests:
- [Velar Artha](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/526)
Older than 12 months:
- [Unstoppable](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/95)
- [Fair Funding](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/42)

## Stylus / Rust

While there have been no audits for Arbitrum Stylus-based projects under the Sherlock branch so far, we have a pool of talented independent security researchers with top experience in Rust and/or Stylus.

TODO: Either list the researchers here (this is not what they are asking for though) or maybe we list Rust based Audits (not Stylus)
TODO: We could also list the Stylus audits from other platforms, with SRs we have (probably not a good idea)


Some examples of top Rust-based audits in the last 12 months:
Contests:
- [ZetaChain Cross-Chain](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/857)
- [Orderly Solana Vault Contract](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/524)
- [WOOFi Swap on Solana](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/535)
- [Andromeda - Validator Staking ADO and Vesting ADO](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/368)
Collab Audits:
- GMX Solana
- Rain Solana
- Wasabi Solana
- Brevis ZK CoProcessor

## Strong understanding of blockchain security fundamentals, vulnerability classifications, and threat modeling.

Sherlock is known to have a strict and proven ruleset for vulnerability classification. With our collaborative audits under the Sherlock and Blackthorn brands, we can provide additional services, like detailed threat modeling or providing a fuzzing test suite. Our security researchers have proven a strong understanding of blockchain security fundamentals showcased by auditing several L1 and L2 chains, VM implementations, as well as having secured system contracts for the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade written in bytecode.

Audit Contests:
- [ZetaChain Cross-Chain](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/857)
- [Babylon Chain Launch (Phase-2)](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/677)
- [Allora](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/454)
- [Optimism Fault Proofs](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/205)

Collaborative Audits:
- PECTRA Audit
- Interchain Labs CosmWasm v2 Audit 
- Interchain Labs IBC Eureka-
- IOTA EVM

## Familiarity with the Arbitrum ecosystem, architecture, and tooling.

Sherlock organized a pre-audit for Arbitrum's BOLD implementation. Our pool of researchers is well-versed in the Arbitrum ecosystem.
