  • CDP protocols
  • ERC4626

**vinica_boy**

- Audited multiple CDP protocols (e.g., Jigsaw, FlatMoney) and ERC4626 implementations
- Identified critical issues such as DoS vulnerabilities, incorrect gas limit calculations, and token transfer failures
- Experienced with Beraborrow’s core systems, having audited it previously
- Skilled in:
  • Collateral management
  • Debt position logic
  • ERC4626 vault mechanics
  • Yield generation
  • Withdrawal safeguards

**giraffe0x**  

- **DeFi & ERC4626 Audit Expertise**: giraffe0x has audited critical protocols like **MakerDAO Endgame** (CDP), **Abracadabra Money** (CDP), and **Foil** (ERC4626 vaults), identifying vulnerabilities such as **TVL manipulation risks**, **input validation flaws**, and **front-running exploits**. His work on DEXes like **Salty.io** and **Jala Swap** demonstrates proficiency in liquidity and yield systems.  
- **CDP and Protocol-Specific Experience**: With hands-on experience in CDP systems (e.g., MakerDAO, Abracadabra) and vault implementations (e.g., Foil), giraffe0x understands the interplay between collateral management, debt issuance, and yield mechanics—key components of Beraborrow’s ERC4626 integration.  
- **Why Ideal for Beraborrow**: His track record of uncovering critical flaws in **collateralized protocols** and **vault architectures** ensures rigorous validation of the LiquityV2 fork’s new ERC4626 layer. His prior work on similar systems (e.g., Synthetix, Mux) aligns with the need to mitigate risks in leveraged and yield-generating environments.  


**fugazzi**  

- **ERC4626 & DeFi Audit Expertise**: Fugazzi’s **2nd-place finish in Amphor’s ERC4626 vault audit** underscores his ability to identify critical flaws in ERC4626-based systems, such as **funds loss during redeems**, **incorrect epoch calculations**, and **miscalculations in asset-to-share conversions**. His work on **Aave v3.3** (a foundational DeFi protocol) further highlights his proficiency in complex financial mechanics.  
- **Track Record in High-Stakes Audits**: With Sherlock contest wins and findings in protocols like **TITLES** (EIP-712 compatibility issues) and **Avail** (security-critical vulnerabilities), fugazzi has consistently demonstrated expertise in mitigating systemic risks across DeFi architectures.  
- **Why Ideal for Beraborrow**: His hands-on experience auditing **ERC4626 implementations** (Amphor) and **leveraged systems** (Aave) ensures rigorous validation of Beraborrow’s new vault integration. His ability to uncover edge cases—such as flawed epoch logic or fee miscalculations—aligns with the project’s need for precision in both debt position management and yield generation.
