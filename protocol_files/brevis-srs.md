# Brevis


## Sergei K (Cergyk)

• **Experience**: Experienced in auditing Zero-Knowledge protocols or integrations, studied Circom and participated in Veridise's Zero-Knowledge circuits workshop 
• **Achievements**: 1st place in Succinct SP1 audit contest and leading the audit for Gamma's integration of Brevis. #3 in Secureum CIRCOM Race
• **Recognition**: Lead Senior Watson on Sherlock, top-ranked on ELO leaderboard
• **Why a Good Fit**: cergyk's practical expertise in auditing ZK circuits makes him an ideal candidate for scrutinizing Brevis' zK CoProcessor.

## LonelySloth

• **Experience**: OG whitehat security researcher with multiple years of experience finding critical vulnerabilities in Web3 & zK protocols, like MakerDAO or Aztec
• **Achievements**: Discovered critical bugs in Aztec's ZK circuits using TurboPLONK
• **Recognition**: Ranked #5 on the all-time Immunefi leaderboard 
• **Why a Good Fit**: LonelySloth's extensive background in hunting critical bugs in cryptographic systems makes them highly suitable for auditing Brevis' zK CoProcessor, particularly its Plonky2 and gnarth (R1CS) ZK Circuits.



## Carlos (CPerrez)

• **Experience**: Expert security researcher with a strong focus on Zero-Knowledge and blockchain security, with experience:
  • Collaborating with the Polygon team to build their zkEVM
  • Contributing to Halo2Curves and other key ZKP projects
• **Skills**: Proficient in Rust programming & auditing, Cryptographic protocols & Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technologies
• **Achievements**: Audited significant projects like Axiom with Spearbit, and contributes to maintaining crucial cryptographic libraries as a member of the Ethereum Foundation's PSE team
• **Why a Good Fit**: Carlos' expertise in Rust, cryptography, and ZKPs, combined with his experience building and auditing ZK-related projects, makes him highly suitable for auditing Brevis' zK CoProcessor, particularly its Plonky2 and gnarth (R1CS) ZK Circuits.



## Onur Kilic

• **Experience**: Seasoned whitehat security researcher and developer with a strong focus on Zero-Knowledge and blockchain security, with contributions to Halo2Curves (top contributor), Winterfell, Plonky3 & other ZK-related projects
• **Achievements**: Discovered a high-impact vulnerability in Plonky3, a core dependency of Succint SP1, and worked with the Plonky3 team to mitigate the issue
• **Skills**: Proficient in ZK-related development and security research as well as Cryptographic protocols and libraries
• **Why a Good Fit**: Onur's extensive experience in ZK-related development and security research, combined with his track record of finding critical vulnerabilities in ZK projects, makes him highly suitable for auditing Brevis' zK CoProcessor, particularly its Plonky2 and gnarth (R1CS) ZK Circuits.
