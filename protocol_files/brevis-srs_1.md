# Brevis


## Sergei K (Cergyk)

- **Experience**: Experienced in auditing Zero-Knowledge protocols or integrations, studied Circom and participated in Veridise's Zero-Knowledge circuits workshop 
- **Achievements**: 1st place in Succinct SP1 audit contest and leading the audit for Gamma's integration of Brevis. #3 in Secureum CIRCOM Race
- **Recognition**: Lead Senior Watson on Sherlock, top-ranked on ELO leaderboard
- **Why a Good Fit**: cergyk's practical expertise in auditing ZK circuits makes him an ideal candidate for scrutinizing Brevis' zK CoProcessor.

## Sammy

- **Experience**: Seasoned security researcher with expertise in L1 and L2 blockchains, cross-chain bridges, and Zero-Knowledge cryptography, having audited Aleo (a ZK-based L1) and Morph L2, and recently taking first place in the Gamma Brevis Rewarder contest, which integrated with Brevis' ZK CoProcessor
- **Achievements**: Proven track record of identifying critical vulnerabilities, with top placements in multiple audit contests, including first place in the Gamma Brevis Rewarder contest and second place in the Aleo contest, which focused on low-level logic for their ZK VM
- **Skills**: Skilled in auditing complex cryptography and blockchain systems, with a strong understanding of VM security, state consistency, and ZK integrations
- **Why a Good Fit**: Sammy's expertise in Zero-Knowledge cryptography, combined with his experience auditing complex VMs and identifying critical vulnerabilities, makes him a strong candidate for auditing Brevis' zK CoProcessor. 



## Carlos (CPerrez)

- **Experience**: Expert security researcher with a strong focus on Zero-Knowledge and blockchain security, with experience:
  - Collaborating with the Polygon team to build their zkEVM
  - Contributing to Halo2Curves and other key ZKP projects
- **Skills**: Proficient in Rust programming & auditing, Cryptographic protocols & Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technologies
- **Achievements**: Audited significant projects like Axiom with Spearbit, and contributes to maintaining crucial cryptographic libraries as a member of the Ethereum Foundation's PSE team
- **Why a Good Fit**: Carlos' expertise in Rust, cryptography, and ZKPs, combined with his experience building and auditing ZK-related projects, makes him highly suitable for auditing Brevis' zK CoProcessor, particularly its Plonky2 and gnarth (R1CS) ZK Circuits.



## Onur Kilic

- **Experience**: Seasoned whitehat security researcher and developer with a strong focus on Zero-Knowledge and blockchain security, with contributions to Halo2Curves (top contributor), Winterfell, Plonky3 & other ZK-related projects
- **Achievements**: Discovered a high-impact vulnerability in Plonky3, a core dependency of Succint SP1, and worked with the Plonky3 team to mitigate the issue
- **Skills**: Proficient in ZK-related development and security research as well as Cryptographic protocols and libraries
- **Why a Good Fit**: Onur's extensive experience in ZK-related development and security research, combined with his track record of finding critical vulnerabilities in ZK projects, makes him highly suitable for auditing Brevis' zK CoProcessor, particularly its Plonky2 and gnarth (R1CS) ZK Circuits.
