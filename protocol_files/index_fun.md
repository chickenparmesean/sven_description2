## Index.Fun


Index.fun is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of custom indices, which are baskets of assets that track a particular market or strategy.

* The platform utilizes smart contracts on the Base blockchain to manage index creation, rebalancing, and trading.
* Key features include:
  • Custom index creation: users can define their own indices using a variety of assets.
  • Decentralized index management: smart contracts automate index rebalancing and management.
  • Trading and liquidity provision: users can trade indices and provide liquidity to earn fees.
  • Transparent and auditable: all index data and transactions are on-chain, ensuring transparency and auditability.


### Overview of the Contracts

1. **`AccessManager`**: This contract manages access control for the binary market platform. It uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControlEnumerable` contract to manage roles and permissions.
2. **`BinaryMarket`**: This contract represents a single binary market, where users can place bets on the outcome of an event. It tracks user bets, round results, and rewards.
3. **`BulkOracle`**: This contract allows an oracle (a designated role) to set the results of multiple binary markets in a single transaction.
4. **`IndexSlotRegister`**: This contract manages the registration of index slots, which are used to create new binary markets. It tracks the ownership of index slots and the associated market contracts.
5. **`PayToken`**: This is a mock ERC-20 token contract used for testing purposes.

### Technical Summary

The platform uses a modular design, with separate contracts for access control, market logic, and index slot registration.

*   The `AccessManager` contract ensures that only authorized users can perform certain actions, such as setting round results or withdrawing funds.
*   The `BinaryMarket` contract is the core of the platform, handling user bets, round results, and rewards. It uses the `AccessManager` contract to verify permissions.
*   The `BulkOracle` contract provides a convenient way for oracles to set the results of multiple markets in a single transaction, reducing gas costs and improving efficiency.
*   The `IndexSlotRegister` contract manages the creation and ownership of index slots, which are used to create new binary markets.

### Key Features

*   **Oracle**: The `BulkOracle` contract allows oracles to set the results of multiple markets in a single transaction.
