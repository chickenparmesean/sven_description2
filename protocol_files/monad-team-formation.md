### **4-SR Team**
- **Guido Vranken** (Top-tier): Expertise in Execution Layer, Compiler & VM, and Networking. Crucial for cryptographic security and low-level C/C++ auditing.
- **David Theodore** (Top-tier): Covers Execution Layer, Compiler & VM, and Data Availability. Essential for ZK security and fuzzing expertise.
- **Defsec Team** (Top-tier): Focuses on Execution Layer and MonadDB (TrieDB). Vital for parallel execution and state consistency analysis.
- **mxuse** (Lower-tier): Addresses Consensus, Networking, and Execution Layer. Key for BFT consensus and DoS resilience.

**Reasoning:**  
This team ensures coverage of all critical scopes—Execution Layer, Consensus, Networking, Compiler & VM, Data Availability, and MonadDB—with at least one auditor per scope. The three top-tier auditors (Guido Vranken, David Theodore, and Defsec Team) provide expertise in Execution Layer, Compiler & VM, Networking, Data Availability, and MonadDB, while mxuse adds essential Consensus and Networking skills, meeting the requirement of at least three top-tier auditors.

### **6-SR Team**
- **Guido Vranken** (Top-tier): Expertise in Execution Layer, Compiler & VM, and Networking. Crucial for cryptographic security and low-level C/C++ auditing.
- **David Theodore** (Top-tier): Covers Execution Layer, Compiler & VM, and Data Availability. Essential for ZK security and fuzzing expertise.
- **Defsec Team** (Top-tier): Focuses on Execution Layer and MonadDB (TrieDB). Vital for parallel execution and state consistency analysis.
- **Sammy** (Top-tier): Specializes in Compiler & VM and Execution Layer. Adds depth with VM non-determinism and ZK system expertise.
- **mxuse** (Lower-tier): Addresses Consensus, Networking, and Execution Layer. Key for BFT consensus and DoS resilience.
- **0xdeadbeef** (Lower-tier): Specializes in Execution Layer and Consensus. Strengthens EVM compatibility and chain stability auditing.

**Reasoning:**  
This team offers comprehensive coverage with multiple auditors per critical scope—Execution Layer, Consensus, Networking, Compiler & VM, Data Availability, and MonadDB. The four top-tier auditors (Guido Vranken, David Theodore, Defsec Team, and Sammy) ensure depth in Execution Layer, Compiler & VM, Networking, Data Availability, and MonadDB, while mxuse and 0xdeadbeef provide additional support for Consensus and Execution Layer, satisfying the requirement of at least four top-tier auditors.
