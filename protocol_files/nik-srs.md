### **deadrosesxyz (bughunter)**  

- **VE Tokenomics & Staking Specialist**: With **over 100 high/medium-severity findings** in VE-based systems (Velodrome, veRWA, Convergence), deadrosesxyz has uncovered critical flaws in **rarity cap mechanics**, **ve-token inflation models**, and **epoch-based reward distribution**. His work on **Velocimeter’s governance edge cases** and **Convergence’s veSTG bonding curves** directly aligns with NIK’s **ve-Token staking modifications** and **governance mechanics**.  
- **DEX & Uniswap-Based Protocol Expertise**: Having audited **Uniswap V4**, **JalaSwap**, and **ExtraFi**, he has identified **liquidity pool vulnerabilities**, **pool creation exploits**, and **price oracle dependency risks**—critical for NIK’s **Uniswap-derived AMM systems** and **liquidity fragmentation safeguards**.  
- **Bug Bounty Track Record**: Over **70 high-severity findings** in audit contests (e.g., **Arkham’s DAO management flaws**, **LEVEL’s ve-token locking exploits**, **Mux Protocol’s governance bribing vectors**) demonstrate his ability to uncover **edge-case exploits** in complex tokenomics and staking systems.  
- **Leadership & Reputation**: As **Lead Senior Watson** on Sherlock (ranked #17 all-time), his **10+ first-place finishes** (e.g., **Uniswap V4’s cross-contract reentrancy**, **JalaSwap’s fee distribution miscalculations**) underscore his proficiency in **high-stakes protocol validation**.  
- **Why Ideal for NIK**: deadrosesxyz’s **VE tokenomics scrutiny** (e.g., **veRWA’s collateralization flaws**) and **DEX AMM validation** (e.g., **ExtraFi’s impermanent loss mitigation gaps**) ensure rigorous review of NIK’s **ve-Token staking logic** and **Uniswap fork mechanics**. His ability to uncover **governance bribing vectors** (Mux Protocol) and **epoch reward miscalculations** (Velodrome) directly addresses NIK’s governance and liquidity risk layers.
