** Rust & Cairo Expertise**  
As an exclusive Sherlock & Blackthorn auditor, **[bin2chen](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/bin2chen)** combines deep **Rust proficiency**â€”proven through top-tier performance in Rust-based contests (e.g., [Andromeda Validator Staking](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/368))â€”with **hands-on Cairo audit experience** in Starknet-focused projects. His transition into Cairo systems leverages his foundational understanding of Rust, the language underpinning Cairoâ€™s design, enabling him to bridge expertise between the two ecosystems.  

**Relevant Cairo & Starknet Experience**  
- **[Starknet Staking Contest (May '25)](http://codehawks.cyfrin.io/c/2024-09-starknet-staking/results?lt=&page=1&sc=reward&sj=reward&t=leaderboard):** Identified logic flaws in staking mechanisms, addressing validator reward and slashing edge cases.  
- **[Kakarot Cairo Audit (Sep '24)](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-09-kakarot):** Contributed to uncovering permission and state-management issues in Cairo contracts.  
- **[Optimism Superchain Audit (Mar '24)](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-07-optimism-superchain):** Applied ZK/systems thinking to secure Cairo-based cross-chain infrastructure.  
- **[zkSync Era Audits](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-03-zksync-era):** Detected critical flaws in L2 system contracts (e.g., frozen chain conditions, fee refund mismanagement), directly informing ZK-rollup security best practices.  

**Strengths for Starknet Audits**  
1. **Cairo Systems Focus:** Practical experience in Cairo audits, with a track record in Starknet-aligned projects like **Starknet Staking** and **Kakarot**, ensures familiarity with Cairoâ€™s unique constraints (e.g., proof systems, state transitions).  
2. **ZK-Rollup Synergy:** Work on **zkSync Era** and **Hyperlane** highlights his ability to address ZK-specific risks (e.g., fraud proofs, circuit design) relevant to Starknetâ€™s architecture.  
3. **Cross-Chain Expertise:** Secured protocols like **Hyperlane** and **Tapioca**, which interact with Starknet, demonstrating fluency in Starknetâ€™s cross-chain attack surfaces.  
4. **Contest Pedigree:** Consistently ranks in top tiers of Cairo-focused contests (e.g., [Kakarot](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-09-kakarot), [Optimism](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-07-optimism-superchain)), validating his ability to spot high-impact vulnerabilities.  

**Why bin2chen Fits Starknet Audits**  
His Rust-to-Cairo pipeline mastery, combined with direct Starknet/ZK audit experience, ensures rigorous testing of Cairo contracts and Starknet system designs. By focusing on Starknetâ€™s unique threat modelsâ€”such as CairoVM interactions, proof validity, and L2-specific reentrancyâ€”bin2chen delivers actionable insights tailored to the ecosystemâ€™s demands.
